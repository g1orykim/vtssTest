<h1>STP CIST Port Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect the
current <a href="glossary.htm#rstp" class="glossary">STP</a> CIST port
configurations, and possibly change them as well.</p>

<p class="haveAggregations">This page contains settings for physical and 
 <a href="glossary.htm#aggregation" class="glossary">aggregated</a> ports.
 <span class="SPOM_only">The aggregation settings are stack global.</span>
</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The STP port settings relate to the currently
selected stack unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   The switch port number of the logical STP port.
 </dd>

 <dt>STP Enabled</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls whether STP is enabled on this switch port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Path Cost</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls the path cost incurred by the port. The <samp>Auto</samp>
   setting will set the path cost as appropriate by the physical link
   speed, using the 802.1D recommended values. Using
   the <samp>Specific</samp> setting, a user-defined value can be
   entered. The path cost is used when establishing the active topology of
   the network. Lower path cost ports are chosen as forwarding ports in favour
   of higher path cost ports.
   Valid values are in the range 1 to 200000000.
 </dd>

 <dt>Priority</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls the port priority. This can be used to control priority of ports
   having identical port cost. (See above).
 </dd>

 <dt>operEdge (state flag)</dt>
 <dd>
   Operational flag describing whether the port is connecting directly
   to edge devices. (<i>No</i> Bridges attached). Transition to
   the forwarding state is faster for edge ports (having
   <em>operEdge</em> <i>true</i>) than for other ports. The value of this flag is based on AdminEdge and AutoEdge fields. This flag is displayed as Edge in Monitor->Spanning Tree -> STP Detailed Bridge Status.
 </dd>

 <dt>AdminEdge</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls whether the <em>operEdge</em> flag should start as 
   set or cleared. (The initial <em>operEdge</em> state when a port is
   initialized).
 </dd>

 <dt>AutoEdge</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls whether the bridge should enable automatic edge detection
   on the bridge port. This allows <em>operEdge</em> to be derived
   from whether BPDU's are received on the port or not.
 </dd>

 <dt>Restricted Role</dt>
 <dd>
   If enabled, causes the port not to be selected as Root Port for the
   CIST or any MSTI, even if it has the best spanning tree priority
   vector. Such a port will be selected as an Alternate Port after the
   Root Port has been selected. If set, it can cause lack of spanning
   tree connectivity. It can be set by a network administrator to
   prevent bridges external to a core region of the network
   influence the spanning tree active topology, possibly because
   those bridges are not under the full control of the
   administrator. This feature is also known as <strong>Root
   Guard</strong>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Restricted TCN</dt>

 <dd>
   If enabled, causes the port not to propagate received topology
   change notifications and topology changes to other ports. If set it
   can cause temporary loss of connectivity after changes in a
   spanning tree's active topology as a result of persistently
   incorrect learned station location information. It is set by a
   network administrator to prevent bridges external to a core region
   of the network, causing address flushing in that region, possibly
   because those bridges are not under the full control of the
   administrator or the physical link state of the attached LANs
   transits frequently.
 </dd>

 <dt class="hasStpEnhancements">BPDU Guard</dt>

 <dd class="hasStpEnhancements">
   If enabled, causes the port to disable itself upon receiving valid
   BPDU's. Contrary to the similar bridge setting, the
   port <samp>Edge</samp> status does not effect this setting.
   <p>
   A port entering error-disabled state due to this setting is subject
   to the bridge <a href="help_mstp_sys_config.htm#recovery">Port
   Error Recovery</a> setting as well.
 </dd>

 <dt>Point-to-Point</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls whether the port connects to a point-to-point LAN rather than to a shared
   medium. This can be automatically determined, or forced either true or false. Transition
   to the forwarding state is faster for point-to-point LANs than for shared media.
