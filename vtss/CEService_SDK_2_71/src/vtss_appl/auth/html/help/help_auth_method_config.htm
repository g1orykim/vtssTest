    <h1>Authentication Method Configuration Help</h1>
    <p>
      This page allows you to configure how a user is authenticated when he logs into the
      <span class="Standalone_only">switch</span><span class="SPOM_only">stack</span> via one of the management client interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      The table has one row for each client type and a number of columns, which are:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Client</dt>
      <dd>
        The management client for which the configuration below applies.
      </dd>
      <dt>Methods</dt>
      <dd>
        Method can be set to one of the following values:
        <ul>
        <li>no: Authentication is disabled and login is not possible.</li>
        <li>local: Use the local user database on the <span class="Standalone_only">switch</span>
        <span class="SPOM_only">stack</span> for authentication.</li>
        <li class="has_radius">radius: Use remote <a href="glossary.htm#radius" class="glossary">RADIUS</a>
        server(s) for authentication.</li>
        <li class="has_tacplus">tacacs+: Use remote <a href="glossary.htm#tacplus" class="glossary">TACACS+</a>
        server(s) for authentication.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
      </dd>
      <dd class="AUTH_SERVER">
        Methods that involves remote servers are timed out if the remote servers are offline. In this case the next method is tried.
        Each method is tried from left to right and continues until a method either approves or rejects a user.
        If a remote server is used for primary authentication it is recommended to configure secondary authentication as 'local'.
        This will enable the management client to login via the local user database if none of the configured authentication servers are alive.
