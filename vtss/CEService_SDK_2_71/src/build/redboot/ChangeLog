	* Version 1.17 *UNRELASED* jr1, lu26 targets

	* Fixed Rev 'A' material PLL lock woraround (minor). The
	implemented workaround would NOT wait for the PLL lock to
	occur. The change does not affect non rev 'A' material.

	* Version 1.4 - serval target

	* Added 'layout' command to test/upgrade the FIS layout (for
          WebStaX/SMBStaX/CEServices use).

	* Version 1.3 - serval target

	* Version 1.16 - jr1, lu26 targets

	* Added means to store fault data for the switch application while
	a reboot is ongoing after a system failure (exception or OS
	assertion). The fault data is kept in a reserved area in RAM until
	next reboot, after which the fault data will be moved to flash.

	* Version 1.2 - serval target

	* Fixed initial GPIO alternate function setting for the serial
	  interface. Without this, the serial interface was not active until
	  the main application was loaded.

	* Version 1.1 - serval target

	* Fixed DDR controller re-initialization after software reboot
          (either from bootloader or from Switch Application). The error
          may be provoked after numerous reboots, and would manifest itself
          as a generally unstable memory system.

	* Updated 'fis load -d' to use CRC information from FIS index.

	* Version 1.15 - jr1, lu26 targets

	* Fixes a potential DDR memory controller issue seen on other
          chipsets. The issue has not been reproduced on these targets, but
          is incorporated as a safety measure.

	* Version 1.14 - jr1, lu26 targets

	* Updated 'fis load -d' to use CRC information from FIS index.

	* Added 'layout' command to test/upgrade the FIS layout (for
          WebStaX/SMBStaX/CEServices use).
