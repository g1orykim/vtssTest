<h1>ARP Inspection Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page provides <a href="glossary.htm#arp_inspection" class="glossary">ARP Inspection</a> related configuration.</p>

<h2> Navigating the VLAN Configuration</h2>
<p>
  Each page shows up to 9999 entries from the VLAN table, default being 20, selected through the
  "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries from
  the beginning of the VLAN Table. The first displayed will be the one with the lowest VLAN ID
  found in the VLAN Table.<br/>
  The "VLAN" input fields allow the user to select the starting point in the VLAN Table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the closest next VLAN Table match.
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the next entry of the
  currently displayed VLAN entry as a basis for the next lookup. When the end is reached the warning message is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.
