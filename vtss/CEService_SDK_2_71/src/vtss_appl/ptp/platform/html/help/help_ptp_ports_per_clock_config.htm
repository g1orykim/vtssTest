<h1>PTP Clock's Port Configuration Help</h1>
<p>The port data set is defined in the IEEE 1588 Standard. It holds three groups of data: the static members, the dynamic members, and configurable members which can be set here.</p>

<h2>Port Data Set</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b> Port </b></dt>
<dd>Static member port Identity : Port number [1..max port no]</dd>
<dt><b> Stat </b></dt>
<dd> Dynamic member portState: Current state of the port. </dd>
<dt><b> MDR </b></dt>
<dd> Dynamic member log Min Delay Req Interval: The delay request interval announced by the master.</dd>
<dt><b> Peer Mean Path Del </b></dt>
<dd> The path delay measured by the port in P2P mode. In E2E mode this value is 0 </dd>
<dt><b> Anv </b></dt>
<dd> The interval for issuing announce messages in master state </dd>
<dt><b> ATo </b></dt>
<dd> The timeout for receiving announce messages on the port </dd>
<dt><b> Syv </b></dt>
<dd> The interval for issuing sync messages in master </dd>
<dt><b> Dlm </b></dt>
<dd>Configurable member delayMechanism: The delay mechanism used for the port:</dd>
<dd>e2e	End to end delay measurement</dd>
<dd>p2p	Peer to peer delay measurement.</dd>
<dd>Can be defined per port in an Ordinary/Boundary  clock.</dd>
<dd>In a transparent clock all ports use the same delay mechanism, determined by the clock type.</dd>
<dt><b> MPR </b></dt>
<dd> The interval for issuing Delay_Req messages for the port in E2e mode. This value is announced from the master to the slave in an announce message.  The value is reflected in the MDR field in the Slave </dd>
<dd> The interval for issuing Pdelay_Req messages for the port in P2P mode </dd>
<dd> Note: The interpretation of this parameter has changed from release 2.40. In earlier versions the value was interpreted relative to the Sync interval, this was a violation of the standard, so now the value is interpreted as an interval. I.e. MPR = 0 => 1 Delay_Req pr sec, independent of the Sync rate. </dd>
<dt><b> Delay Asymmetry </b></dt>
<dd> If the transmission delay for a link in not symmetric, the asymmetry can be configured here, see IEEE 1588 Section 7.4.2 Communication path asymmetry </dd>
<dt><b> Version </b></dt>
<dd> The current implementation only supports PTP version 2 </dd>
 <dt><b> Ingress latency </b></dt>
 <dd> Ingress latency measured in ns, as defined in IEEE 1588 Section 7.3.4.2. </dd>
 <dt><b> Egress Latency </b></dt>
 <dd> Egress latency measured in ns, as defined in IEEE 1588 Section 7.3.4.2. </dd>
