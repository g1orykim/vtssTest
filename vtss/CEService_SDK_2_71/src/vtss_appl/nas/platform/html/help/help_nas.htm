      This page allows you to configure the <a href="glossary.htm#dot1x" class="glossary">IEEE 802.1X</a> <span class="has_nas_mac_based">
      and MAC-based authentication</span> system and port settings.<br/><br/>
      The IEEE 802.1X standard defines a port-based access control procedure that prevents unauthorized access to a network by
      requiring users to first submit credentials for authentication. One or more central servers, the backend servers, determine whether
      the user is allowed access to the network. These backend (RADIUS) servers are configured on the "Configuration&rarr;Security&rarr;AAA" page.
      <span class="NAS_SINGLE_OR_MULTI">
      The IEEE802.1X standard defines port-based operation, but non-standard variants overcome security limitations as shall be explored below.
      </span>
      <span class="has_nas_mac_based"><br/><br/>
      MAC-based authentication allows for authentication of more than one user on the same port, and doesn't require the
      user to have special 802.1X supplicant software installed on his system. The switch uses the user's MAC address to authenticate
      against the backend server. Intruders can create counterfeit MAC addresses, which makes MAC-based authentication less
      secure than 802.1X authentication.

          In this mode, the switch will send one EAPOL Success frame when the port link comes up, and any client on the port

        <h2><a name="force_unauth">Force Unauthorized</a></h2>
          In this mode, the switch will send one EAPOL Failure frame when the port link comes up, and any client on the port
          will be disallowed network access.

        <h2><a name="auto"><span class="NAS_SINGLE_OR_MULTI">Port-based </span>802.1X</a></h2>
          In the 802.1X-world, the user is called the supplicant, the switch is the authenticator, and the RADIUS server is
          the authentication server. The authenticator acts as the man-in-the-middle, forwarding requests and responses between the
          supplicant and the authentication server. Frames sent between the supplicant and the switch are special 802.1X frames,
          known as EAPOL (EAP Over LANs) frames. EAPOL frames encapsulate EAP PDUs (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3748">RFC3748</a>).
          Frames sent between the switch and the RADIUS server are <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2865.txt">RADIUS</a> packets. RADIUS packets also encapsulate EAP PDUs
          together with other attributes like the switch's IP address, name, and the supplicant's port number on the switch.
          EAP is very flexible, in that it allows for different authentication methods, like
          <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3748">MD5-Challenge</a>,
          <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-01">PEAP</a>, and
          <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2716.txt">TLS</a>. The important thing is that the authenticator (the switch)
          doesn't need to know which authentication method the supplicant and the authentication server are using, or how many
          information exchange frames are needed for a particular method. The switch simply encapsulates the EAP part of
          the frame into the relevant type (EAPOL or RADIUS) and forwards it.<br/>
          When authentication is complete, the RADIUS server sends a special packet containing a success or failure indication.
          Besides forwarding this decision to the supplicant, the switch uses it to open up or block traffic on the switch
          port connected to the supplicant.<br/>
          <b>Note: </b>Suppose two backend servers are enabled and that the server timeout is configured to X seconds
          (using the AAA configuration page), and suppose that the first server in the list is currently down (but not considered dead).
          Now, if the supplicant retransmits EAPOL Start frames at a rate faster than X seconds, then it will never get authenticated,
          because the switch will cancel on-going backend authentication server requests whenever it receives a new EAPOL Start frame
          from the supplicant. And since the server hasn't yet failed (because the X seconds haven't expired), the same server
          will be contacted upon the next backend authentication server request from the switch. This scenario will loop forever.
          Therefore, the server timeout should be smaller than the supplicant's EAPOL Start frame retransmission rate.

        <h2 class="has_nas_dot1x_single"><a name="single">Single 802.1X</a></h2>
        <span class="has_nas_dot1x_single">
          In port-based 802.1X authentication, once a supplicant is successfully authenticated on a port, the whole port is opened
          for network traffic. This allows other clients connected to the port (for instance through a hub) to piggy-back on the
          successfully authenticated client and get network access even though they really aren't authenticated. To overcome
          this security breach, use the Single 802.1X variant.<br/>
          Single 802.1X is really not an IEEE standard, but features many of the same characteristics as does port-based 802.1X.
          In Single 802.1X, at most one supplicant can get authenticated on the port at a time. Normal EAPOL frames are used
          in the communication between the supplicant and the switch. If more than one supplicant is connected to a port, the
          one that comes first when the port's link comes up will be the first one considered. If that supplicant doesn't
          provide valid credentials within a certain amount of time, another supplicant will get a chance. Once a supplicant
          is successfully authenticated, only that supplicant will be allowed access. This is the most secure of all the
          supported modes. In this mode, the <a href="help_psec_status_switch.htm">Port Security</a> module is used to secure
          a supplicant's MAC address once successfully authenticated.

          In Multi 802.1X it is not possible to use the multicast BPDU MAC address as destination MAC address for EAPOL frames sent
          from the switch towards the supplicant, since that would cause all supplicants attached to the port to reply to requests
          sent from the switch. Instead, the switch uses the supplicant's MAC address, which is obtained from the first EAPOL Start
          or EAPOL Response Identity frame sent by the supplicant. An exception to this is when no supplicants are attached. In this
          case, the switch sends EAPOL Request Identity frames using the BPDU multicast MAC address as destination - to wake up
          any supplicants that might be on the port.<br/>

        <span class="has_nas_mac_based">
          Unlike <span class="NAS_SINGLE_OR_MULTI">port-based </span>802.1X, MAC-based authentication is not a standard, but merely a
          best-practices method adopted by the industry.
          In MAC-based authentication, users are called clients, and the switch acts as the supplicant on behalf of clients.
          The initial frame (any kind of frame) sent by a client is snooped by the switch, which in turn uses the client's
          MAC address as both username and password in the subsequent EAP exchange with the RADIUS server. The 6-byte MAC address
          is converted to a string on the following form "xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx", that is, a dash (-) is used as separator between
          the lower-cased hexadecimal digits. The switch only supports the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3748">MD5-Challenge</a>
          authentication method, so the RADIUS server must be configured accordingly.<br/>
          When authentication is complete, the RADIUS server sends a success or failure indication, which in turn causes the switch
          to open up or block traffic for that particular client, using the <a href="help_psec_status_switch.htm">Port Security</a>
          module. Only then will frames from the client be forwarded on the switch. There are no EAPOL frames involved in this authentication,
          and therefore, MAC-based Authentication has nothing to do with the 802.1X standard.<br/>
          <span class="NAS_NO_SINGLE_NO_MULTI">
            The advantage of MAC-based authentication over port-based 802.1X is that several clients can be connected to the same port (e.g.
            through a 3rd party switch or a hub) and still require individual authentication, and that the clients don't need
            special supplicant software to authenticate.

          The disadvantage is that MAC addresses can be spoofed by malicious users - equipment whose MAC address is a valid

          The <code>User-Priority-Table</code> attribute defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4675">RFC4675</a>
          forms the basis for identifying the QoS Class in an Access-Accept packet.<br/>
          Only the first occurrence of the attribute in the packet will be considered, and to be valid, it must follow this rule:<br/>
          &nbsp;&bull; All 8 octets in the attribute's value must be identical and consist of ASCII characters in
          the range '0' - '<span id="qm_1">7</span>', which translates into the desired QoS Class in the range [0; <span id="qm_2">7</span>].

        When RADIUS-Assigned VLAN is both <a href="#backend_vlan_glbl">globally</a> enabled and enabled (checked)
        for a given port, the switch reacts to VLAN ID information carried in the RADIUS Access-Accept packet
        transmitted by the RADIUS server when a supplicant is successfully authenticated. If present and valid,
        the port's Port VLAN ID will be changed to this VLAN ID, the port will be set to be a member of that
        VLAN ID, and the port will be forced into VLAN unaware mode. Once assigned, all traffic arriving on
        the port will be classified and switched on the RADIUS-assigned VLAN ID.<br/>
        If (re-)authentication fails or the RADIUS Access-Accept packet no longer carries a VLAN ID or
        it's invalid, or the supplicant is otherwise no longer present on the port, the port's VLAN ID is immediately
        reverted to the original VLAN ID (which may be changed by the administrator in the meanwhile without
        affecting the RADIUS-assigned).<br/>

        <u>RADIUS attributes used in identifying a VLAN ID:</u><br/>
        <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2868">RFC2868</a> and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3580">RFC3580</a> form
        the basis for the attributes used in identifying a VLAN ID in an Access-Accept packet. The following criteria
        are used:<br/>
        &nbsp;&bull; The <code>Tunnel-Medium-Type</code>, <code>Tunnel-Type</code>, and <code>Tunnel-Private-Group-ID</code>
        attributes must all be present at least once in the Access-Accept packet.<br/>
        &nbsp;&bull; The switch looks for the first set of these attributes that have the same <code>Tag</code> value and
        fulfil the following requirements (if <code>Tag</code> == 0 is used, the <code>Tunnel-Private-Group-ID</code>
        does not need to include a <code>Tag</code>):<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; - Value of <code>Tunnel-Medium-Type</code> must be set to "IEEE-802" (ordinal 6).<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; - Value of <code>Tunnel-Type</code> must be set to "VLAN" (ordinal 13).<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; - Value of <code>Tunnel-Private-Group-ID</code> must be a string of ASCII chars in the
        range '0' - '9', which is interpreted as a decimal string representing the VLAN ID. Leading '0's are
        discarded. The final value must be in the range [1; 4095].

        When Guest VLAN is both <a href="#guest_vlan_glbl">globally</a> enabled and enabled (checked)

        <u>Guest VLAN Operation:</u><br/>
        When a Guest VLAN enabled port's link comes up, the switch starts transmitting
        EAPOL Request Identity frames. If the number of transmissions of such frames exceeds
        <a href="#max_reauth_cnt">Max. Reauth. Count</a> and no EAPOL frames have been received in the meanwhile,
        the switch considers entering the Guest VLAN. The interval between transmission of EAPOL Request Identity
        frames is configured with <a href="#eapol_timeout">EAPOL Timeout</a>.
        If <a href="#guest_vlan_allow_eapol">Allow Guest VLAN if EAPOL Seen</a> is enabled, the port will now
        be placed in the Guest VLAN. If disabled, the switch will first check its history to see if an EAPOL
        frame has previously been received on the port (this history is cleared if the port link goes down or the
        port's <a href="#admin_state">Admin State</a> is changed), and if not, the port will be placed in the Guest VLAN.
        Otherwise it will not move to the Guest VLAN, but continue transmitting EAPOL Request Identity frames
        at the rate given by EAPOL Timeout.<br/>
        Once in the Guest VLAN, the port is considered authenticated, and all attached clients on the port
        are allowed access on this VLAN. The switch will not transmit an EAPOL Success frame when entering
        the Guest VLAN.<br/>
        While in the Guest VLAN, the switch monitors the link for EAPOL frames, and if one such frame is
        received, the switch immediately takes the port out of the Guest VLAN and starts authenticating
        the supplicant according to the port mode. If an EAPOL frame is received, the port will never be able to go
        back into the Guest VLAN if the "Allow Guest VLAN if EAPOL Seen" is disabled.
