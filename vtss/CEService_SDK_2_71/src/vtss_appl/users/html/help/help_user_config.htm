<h1>Add/Edit User Help</h1>

<p>This page configures a user.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>User Name</dt>
 <dd>
 A string identifying the user name that this entry should belong to. The allowed string length is <samp>1</samp> to <samp><span id="usernameMaxLen">31</span></samp>. The valid user name allows letters, numbers and underscores.
 </dd>

 <dt>Password</dt>
 <dd>
 The password of the user. The allowed string length is <samp>0</samp> to <samp><span id="passwordMaxLen">31</span></samp>. Any printable characters including space is accepted.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_priv_lvl">Privilege Level</dt>
 <dd>
 The privilege level of the user. The allowed range is <samp>1</samp> to <samp>15</samp>.
 If the privilege level value is 15, it can access all groups, i.e. that is granted the fully control of the device.
 But others value need to refer to each group privilege level. User's privilege should be same or greater than the group privilege level to have the access of that group.
 By default setting, most groups privilege level 5 has the read-only access and privilege level 10 has the read-write access.
 And the system maintenance (software upload, factory defaults and etc.) need user privilege level 15.
 Generally, the privilege level 15 can be used for an administrator account,
 privilege level 10 for a standard user account and privilege level 5 for a guest account.
