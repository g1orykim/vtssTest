<h1>VLAN Membership Status Help</h1>
<p>This page provides an overview of  membership status of VLAN users.</p>
<p class="SPOM_only">The ports belong to the currently selected stack unit as reflected by the page header.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>VLAN User</dt>
  <dd>
    Various internal software modules may use VLAN services to configure VLAN memberships on the fly.<br/>
    The drop-down list on the right allows for selecting between showing VLAN memberships as configured by an administrator (Admin) or as configured by one of these internal software modules.<br/>
    The "Combined" entry will show a combination of the administrator and internal software modules configuration, and basically reflects what is actually configured in hardware.
  </dd>

  <dt>VLAN ID</dt>
  <dd>
    VLAN ID for which the Port members are displayed.
  </dd>

  <dt>Port Members</dt>
  <dd>
    A row of check boxes for each port is displayed for each VLAN ID.<br/>
    If a port is included in a VLAN, the following image will be displayed: <img src="../../images/port.gif" alt="port" width=15 height =12 border = 1/>.<br/>
    If a port is in the forbidden port list, the following image will be displayed: <img src = "../../images/forbid.gif" alt="forbid" width=15 height =12 border = 1/>.<br/>
    If a port is in the forbidden port list and at the same time attempted included in the VLAN, the following image will be displayed: <img src = "../../images/conflict.gif" alt="conflict port" width=15 height =12 border = 1/>. The port will not be a member of the VLAN in this case.<br/>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2> Navigating the VLAN Membership Status page</h2>
<p>
Each page shows up to 99 entries from the VLAN table (default being 20), selected through the "entries per page" input field.
When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries from the beginning of the VLAN Table. The first displayed will be the one with the lowest VLAN ID found in the VLAN Table.<br/>
The "VLAN" input field allows the user to select the starting point in the VLAN Table.<br/>
Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from that or the closest next VLAN Table match.<br/>
The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed VLAN entry as a basis for the next lookup.
When the end is reached, the text "No data exists for the selected user" is shown in the table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.
