<h1>QoS Weighted Random Early Detection Help</h1>

<p>This page allows you to configure the Random Early Detection (RED) settings for queue 0 to 5.</p>

<p>RED cannot be applied to queue 6 and 7.</p>

<p>Through different RED configuration for the queues (<a href="glossary.htm#qos_class" class="glossary">QoS classes</a>) it is possible to obtain Weighted Random Early Detection (<a href="glossary.htm#WRED" class="glossary">WRED</a>) operation between queues. </p>

<p>The settings are global for all ports in the <span class="SPOM_only">stack.</span> <span class="Standalone_only">switch.</span></p>

<p>The displayed settings are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Queue</dt>
 <dd>The queue number (QoS class) for which the configuration below applies.</dd>
 
 <dt>Enable</dt>
 <dd>Controls whether RED is enabled for this queue.</dd>
 
 <dt>Min. Threshold</dt>
 <dd>Controls the lower RED threshold.
     If the average queue filling level is below this threshold, the drop probability is zero.
     This value is restricted to 0-100.</dd>
 
 <dt>Max. DP 1</dt>
 <dd>Controls the drop probability for frames marked with <a href="glossary.htm#dpl" class="glossary">Drop Precedence Level</a> 1 when the average queue filling level is 100%.
     This value is restricted to 0-100.</dd>
 
 <dt>Max. DP 2</dt>
 <dd>Controls the drop probability for frames marked with Drop Precedence Level 2 when the average queue filling level is 100%.
     This value is restricted to 0-100.</dd>
 
 <dt>Max. DP 3</dt>
 <dd>Controls the drop probability for frames marked with Drop Precedence Level 3 when the average queue filling level is 100%.
     This value is restricted to 0-100.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>RED Drop Probability Function</h2>
<p>The following illustration shows the drop probability function with associated parameters.</p>

<img src="/images/qos_wred.png" width="715" height="403" border="0" alt="RED Drop Probability Function"> 

<p>Max. DP 1-3 is the drop probability when the average queue filling level is 100%. Frames marked with Drop Precedence Level 0 are never dropped.
Min. Threshold is the average queue filling level where the queues randomly start dropping frames.
The drop probability for frames marked with Drop Precedence Level n increases linearly from zero (at Min. Threshold average queue filling level) to Max. DP n (at 100% average queue filling level).</p>
