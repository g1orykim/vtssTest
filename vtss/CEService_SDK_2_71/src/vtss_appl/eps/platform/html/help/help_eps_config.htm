<h1>Ethernet Protection Switch Configuration Help</h1>

<p> This page allows the user to inspect and configure the current <a href="glossary.htm#EPS" class="glossary">EPS</a> Instance.</p>

<h2>Instance Data</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>EPS ID</dt>
 <dd>
 The ID of the EPS.
 </dd>
 <dt>Domain</dt>

<h2>Instance Configuration</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Configured</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>Red:</b> This EPS is only created and has not yet been configured - is not active.</p>
 <p><b>Green:</b> This EPS is configured - is active.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Protection Type</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>Unidirectional:</b> EPS in the two ends can select traffic from different working/protecting flow. This is only possible in case of 1+1.</p>
 <p><b>Bidirectional:</b>  EPS in the two ends is selecting traffic from the same working/protecting flow. This requires APS enabled. This is mandatory for 1:1</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>APS</dt>
 <dd>
 The Automatic Protection Switching protocol can be enabled/disabled. This is mandatory for 1:1.
 </dd>
 <dt>Revertive</dt>
 <dd>
 The revertive switching to working flow can be enabled/disabled.
 </dd>
 <dt>WTR Time</dt>
 <dd>
 The Wait To Restore timing value to be used in revertive switching.
 </dd>
 <dt>Hold Off Time</dt>
 <dd>
 The timing value to be used to make persistent check on Signal Fail before switching. This is in 100 ms. and the max value is 100 (10 sec).
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Instance Command</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Command</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>None:</b>            There is no active local command on this instance.</p>
 <p><b>Clear:</b>           The active local command will be cleared.</p>
 <p><b>Lock Out:</b>        This EPS is locked to working (not active). In case of 1:N (more than one EPS with same protecting flow) - when one EPS switch to protecting flow, other EPS is enforced this command</p>
 <p><b>Forced Switch:</b>   Forced switch to protecting.</p>
 <p><b>Manual Switch P:</b> Manual switch to protecting.</p>
 <p><b>Manual Switch W:</b> Manual switch to working - this is only possible in 1:1 non-revertive.</p>
 <p><b>Exercise:</b>        Exercise of the protocol - not traffic effecting.</p>
 <p><b>Freeze:</b>          This EPS is locally freezed - ignoring all input.</p>
 <p><b>Lock Out Local:</b>  This EPS is locally "locked out" - ignoring local SF detected on working.</p>
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Instance State</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Protection State</dt>
 <dd>
 EPS state according to State Transition Tables in G.8031.
 </dd>
 <dt>W Flow</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>OK:</b> State of working flow is ok</p>
 <p><b>SF:</b> State of working flow is Signal Fail</p>
 <p><b>SD:</b> State of working flow is Signal Degrade (for future use)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>P Flow</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>OK:</b> State of protecting flow is ok</p>
 <p><b>SF:</b> State of protecting flow is Signal Fail</p>
 <p><b>SD:</b> State of protecting flow is Signal Degrade (for future use)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Transmit APS r/b</dt>
 <dd>
 The transmitted APS according to State Transition Tables in G.8031.
 </dd>
 <dt>Receive APS r/b</dt>
 <dd>
 The received APS according to State Transition Tables in G.8031.
 </dd>
 <dt>Architecture Mismatch</dt>
 <dd>
 The architecture indicated in the received APS does not match the locally configured.
 </dd>
 <dt>APS on working</dt>
 <dd>
 APS is received on the working flow.
 </dd>
 <dt>Switching Incomplete</dt>
 <dd>
 Traffic is not selected from the same flow instance in the two ends.
 </dd>
 <dt>No APS Received</dt>
 <dd>
 APS PDU is not received from the other end.
 </dd>
