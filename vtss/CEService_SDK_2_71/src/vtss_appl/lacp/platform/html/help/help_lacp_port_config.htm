<h1>LACP Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect the
current <a href="glossary.htm#lacp" class="glossary">LACP</a> port
configurations, and possibly change them as well.</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The LACP port settings relate to the currently
selected stack unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   The switch port number.
 </dd>

 <dt>LACP Enabled</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls whether LACP is enabled on this switch port.  
   LACP will form an aggregation when 2 or more ports are connected to the same partner. 
 </dd>
 <dd class="has_arch_jaguar_1">Up to 32 aggregations are supported (if stackable).</dd>

 <dt>Key</dt>
 <dd>
   The Key value incurred by the port, range 1-65535 . The <samp>Auto</samp>
   setting will set the key  as appropriate by the physical link
   speed, 10Mb = 1, 100Mb = 2, 1Gb = 3. Using the <samp>Specific</samp> setting, a user-defined value can be
   entered. Ports with the same Key value can participate in the same aggregation group,
   while ports with different keys cannot. 
 </dd>

 <dt>Role</dt>
 <dd>
   The <samp>Role</samp> shows the LACP activity status.  The <samp>Active</samp> will transmit LACP packets each second,
   while <samp>Passive</samp> will wait for a LACP packet from a partner (speak if spoken to).
 </dd>

 <dt>Timeout</dt>
 <dd>
   The <samp>Timeout</samp> controls the period between BPDU transmissions.  <samp>Fast</samp> will transmit LACP packets each second,
   while <samp>Slow</samp> will wait for 30 seconds before sending a LACP packet.
 </dd>
 <dt>Prio</dt>
 <dd>
   The <samp>Prio</samp> controls the priority of the port.  If the LACP partner wants to form a larger group than is supported by this device 
   then this parameter  will control which ports will be active and which ports will be in a backup role. Lower number means greater priority.
