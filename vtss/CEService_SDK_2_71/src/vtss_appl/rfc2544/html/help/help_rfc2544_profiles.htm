<h1>RFC2544 Profile Overview Help</h1>

<p>
  <a href="glossary.htm#rfc2544">RFC2544</a> is a benchmark testing tool that allows for testing an ethernet service connection end-to-end w.r.t. various key parameters.<br/>
  Each test configuration is called a 'profile', and each result of executing the profile is called a 'report'.
  You can store up to <span class="profile_cnt">?</span> profiles and <span class="report_cnt">?</span> reports.
  Execution of a profile is initiated through the &quot;Configuration&rarr;RFC2544&rarr;Reports&quot; page.<br/><br/>
  Executing a profile causes the switch (near end) to generate and transmit frames at certain rates on the configured egress port.
  The remote end is supposed to loop these frames while swapping source and destination MAC adresses.
  The looped frames are then expected to arrive at the same port as they egressed at the near end. The switch that generated the frames
  can therefore assess whether an ethernet service connection meets the SLA.<br/>
  This switch supports the near-end functionality only (generation + check of frames). Remote end functionality (loop + MAC address swap) is not supported.
</p>

<p>
  This page provides an overview of the defined profiles along with options for editing and deleting them and creating new.<br/>
  If no profiles are currently defined, the table contains one line stating &quot;&lt;No profiles&gt;&quot;.
  Otherwise there is a table row for each defined profile with these three elements:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Delete</dt>
  <dd>
    Click the <input type="button" value=" Delete ">-button to delete the profile in question.
  </dd>

  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd>
    A unique name identifying the profile. Click the name to edit the profile.
  </dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    The profile's description as entered in the profile editor, which is activated by clicing the name of the profile.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><input type="button" value="Add New Profile">: Create a new profile. This button is grayed out if the maximum number of profiles is already defined.</p>
