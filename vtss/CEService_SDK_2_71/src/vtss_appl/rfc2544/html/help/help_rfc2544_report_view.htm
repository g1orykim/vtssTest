<h1>RFC2544 Test Report Viewer Help</h1>

<p>
  Besides showing results of executing a test, test reports contain a copy of all
  input parameters.<br/>
  This web page can show results from both an already executed test and from on-going tests.
  If execution is on-going, you are encouraged to check the Auto-refresh button.
  This will cause the page to refresh every <span class="refreshInterval">?</span>
  seconds and automatically scroll to the bottom of the page, where additional test
  results and status get added continuously.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>RFC2544 Test Report for &lt;test teport name&gt;</dt>
  <dd>
    This is the output of the test report and is identical to what you will get by downloading the report to your computer.<br/>
    At the top it shows overall execution status along with common configuration parameters and a &quot;test-started&quot; timestamp.<br/>
    Subsequent sections show the result of executing given sub-tests along with their configuration parameters.<br/>
    At the bottom of the test report, the overall status of executing the test along with a &quot;test-ended&quot; timestamp is shown.<br/>
    Most lines are at most 80 characters wide, but a few may get wider. Use the resize
    capabilities that some browsers offer to resize the text window to accommodate for
    longer lines.
