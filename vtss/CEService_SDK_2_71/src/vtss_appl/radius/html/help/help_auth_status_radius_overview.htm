    <h1>RADIUS Authentication Overview Help</h1>
    <p>This page provides an overview of the status of the RADIUS servers configurable on the Authentication configuration page.</p>

    <h2>RADIUS Authentication Servers</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>#</dt>
      <dd>The RADIUS server number. Click to navigate to detailed statistics for this server.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>IP Address</dt>
      <dd>The IP address and UDP port number (in &lt;IP Address&gt;:&lt;UDP Port&gt; notation) of this server.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Status</dt>
      <dd>The current status of the server. This field takes one of the following values:<br/>
        <samp>Disabled</samp>: The server is disabled.<br/>
        <samp>Not Ready</samp>: The server is enabled, but IP communication is not yet up and running.<br/>
        <samp>Ready</samp>: The server is enabled, IP communication is up and running, and the RADIUS module is ready to accept access attempts.<br/>
        <samp>Dead (X seconds left)</samp>: Access attempts were made to this server, but it did not reply within the configured timeout.
              The server has temporarily been disabled, but will get re-enabled when the dead-time expires. The number of seconds left before this
              occurs is displayed in parentheses. This state is only reachable when more than one server is enabled.
