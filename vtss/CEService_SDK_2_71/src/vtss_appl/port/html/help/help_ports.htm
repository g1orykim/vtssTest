<h1>Port Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page displays current port configurations. Ports can also be configured here.</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The port settings relate to the currently
selected stack unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
 This is the logical port number for this row.
 </dd>

 <dt>Link</dt>
 <dd>
 The current link state is displayed graphically. Green indicates the link is up and red that it is down.
 </dd>

 <dt>Current Link Speed</dt>
 <dd>
 Provides the current link speed of the port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Configured Link Speed</dt>
 <dd>
 Selects any available link speed for the given switch port. Only speeds
 supported by the specific port is shown.
 Possible speeds are:
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp> - Disables the switch port operation.
 <br><samp>Auto</samp> - Port auto negotiating speed with the link partner
 and selects the highest speed that is compatible with the link partner. 
 <br><samp>10Mbps HDX</samp> - Forces the cu port in 10Mbps half duplex
 mode.
 <br><samp>10Mbps FDX</samp> - Forces the cu port in 10Mbps full duplex mode.
 <br><samp>100Mbps HDX</samp> - Forces the cu port in 100Mbps half duplex
 mode.
 <br><samp>100Mbps FDX</samp> - Forces the cu port in 100Mbps full duplex mode.
 <br><samp>1Gbps FDX</samp> - Forces the port in 1Gbps full duplex
 <br><samp>2.5Gbps FDX</samp> - Forces the Serdes port in 2.5Gbps full duplex
 mode.
 </dd>

 <dd class="PORT_FIBER_CTRL">
  <br><samp>SFP_Auto_AMS</samp> - Automatically determines the speed of the SFP. Note: There is no standardized way to
 do SFP auto detect, so here it is done by reading the SFP rom. Due to
 the missing standardized way of doing SFP auto detect some SFPs might
 not be detectable. The port is set in <a href="glossary.htm#ams" class="glossary">AMS</a> mode. Cu port
 is set in <b>Auto</b> mode.
  <br><samp>100-FX</samp> - SFP port in 100-FX speed. Cu port disabled.
  <br><samp>100-FX_AMS</samp> - Port in <a href="glossary.htm#ams" class="glossary">AMS</a> mode.
  SFP port in 100-FX speed. Cu port in <b>Auto</b> mode.
  <br><samp>1000-X</samp> - SFP port in 1000-X speed. Cu port disabled.
  <br><samp>1000-X_AMS</samp> - Port in <a href="glossary.htm#ams" class="glossary">AMS</a> mode.
  SFP port in 1000-X speed. Cu port in <b>Auto</b> mode.

 <dd class="PORT_1000X_AMS_COPPER_PREFERRED">
   Ports in AMS mode with 1000-X speed has Cu port preferred.
 </dd>

 <dd class="PORT_100FX_AMS_COPPER_PREFERRED">
   Ports in AMS mode with 100-FX speed has Cu port preferred.
 </dd>

 <dd class="PORT_1000X_AMS_FIBER_PREFERRED">
   Ports in AMS mode with 1000-X speed has fiber port preferred.
 </dd>

 <dd class="PORT_100FX_AMS_FIBER_PREFERRED">
   Ports in AMS mode with 100-FX speed has fiber port preferred.
 </dd>


 <dt class="PORT_FLOW_CTRL">Flow Control</dt>
 <dd class="PORT_FLOW_CTRL">
 When <samp>Auto Speed</samp> is selected on a port, this section
indicates the flow control capability that is advertised to the link
partner.  <br>When a fixed-speed setting is selected, that is what is
used.  The Current Rx column indicates whether pause frames on the
port are obeyed, and the Current Tx column indicates whether pause
frames on the port are transmitted. The Rx and Tx settings are
determined by the result of the last
<a href="glossary.htm#autoneg" class="glossary">Auto-Negotiation</a>.<br>Check the configured column to use
flow control. This setting is related to the setting for Configured
Link Speed.
 </dd>

 <dt>Maximum Frame Size</dt>
 <dd>
 Enter the maximum frame size allowed for the switch port, including FCS.
 </dd>

 <dt class="PORT_EXC_CONT">Excessive Collision Mode</dt>
 <dd class="PORT_EXC_CONT">
  Configure port transmit collision behavior.
  <br><samp>Discard</samp>: Discard frame after 16 collisions (default).
  <br><samp>Restart</samp>: Restart backoff algorithm after 16 collisions.
 </dd>
