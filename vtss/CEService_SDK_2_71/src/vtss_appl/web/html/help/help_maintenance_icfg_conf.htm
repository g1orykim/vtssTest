<h1>Maintenance Help</h1>

<h2><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h2>

<p>The switch stores its configuration in a number of text files in CLI format.
 The files are either virtual (RAM-based) or stored in flash on the switch.
</p>
<p>There are three system files:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>running-config</i>: A virtual file that represents the currently active
        configuration on the switch. This file is volatile.</li>
    <li><i>startup-config</i>: The startup configuration for the switch, read at
        boot time.</li>
    <li><i>default-config</i>: A read-only file with vendor-specific configuration.
        This file is read when the system is restored to default settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also possible to store up to two other files and apply them to
<i>running-config</i>, thereby switching configuration.
</p>

<h3><a id="save">Save <i>startup-config</i></a></h3>
<p>This copies <i>running-config</i> to <i>startup-config</i>, thereby ensuring
that the currently active configuration will be used at the next reboot.
</p>

<h3><a id="download">Download</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to download any of the files on the switch to the web browser.
Select the file and click <input type="button" value="Download Configuration">.
<br>Download of <i>running-config</i> may take a little while to complete, as the file
must be prepared for download.
</p>

<h3><a id="upload">Upload</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to upload a file from the web browser to all the files on the
switch, except <i>default-config</i>, which is read-only.<br>
Select the file to upload, select the destination file on the target, then click
<input type="button" value="Upload Configuration">.
</p>
<p>If the destination is <i>running-config</i>, the file will be applied to the
switch configuration. This can be done in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Replace mode: The current configuration is fully replaced with the
    configuration in the uploaded file.</li>
    <li>Merge mode: The uploaded file is merged into <i>running-config</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the file system is full (i.e. contains the three system files mentioned above
plus two other files), it is not possible to create new files, but an existing
file must be overwritten or another deleted first.
</p>

<h3><a id="activate">Activate</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to activate any of the configuration files present on the
switch, except for <i>running-config</i> which represents the currently active
configuration.<br>
Select the file to activate and click <input type="button" value="Activate Configuration">.
This will initiate the process of completely replacing the existing configuration
with that of the selected file.
</p>
<h3><a id="delete">Delete</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to delete any of the writable files stored in flash, including
<i>startup-config</i>. If this is done and the switch is rebooted without a
prior Save operation, this effectively resets the switch to default configuration.
