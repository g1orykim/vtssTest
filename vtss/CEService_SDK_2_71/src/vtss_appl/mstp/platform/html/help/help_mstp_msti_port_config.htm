<h1>STP MSTI Port Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect the
current <a href="glossary.htm#rstp" class="glossary">STP</a> MSTI port
configurations, and possibly change them as well.</p>

<p>
 An MSTI port is a virtual port, which is instantiated separately for
 each active CIST (physical) port for each MSTI instance configured
 on and applicable to the port. The MSTI instance must be selected
 before displaying actual MSTI port configuration options.
</p>

<p class="haveAggregations">This page contains MSTI port settings for
   physical and
 <a href="glossary.htm#aggregation" class="glossary">aggregated</a> ports.
 <span class="SPOM_only">The aggregation settings are stack global.</span>
</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">Apart from the selected MSTI, the STP MSTI port
settings also relate to the currently selected stack unit, as
reflected by the page header.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   The switch port number of the corresponding STP CIST (and MSTI) port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Path Cost</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls the path cost incurred by the port. The <samp>Auto</samp>
   setting will set the path cost as appropriate by the physical link
   speed, using the 802.1D recommended values. Using
   the <samp>Specific</samp> setting, a user-defined value can be
   entered. The path cost is used when establishing the active topology of
   the network. Lower path cost ports are chosen as forwarding ports in favour
   of higher path cost ports.
   Valid values are in the range 1 to 200000000.
 </dd>

 <dt>Priority</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls the port priority. This can be used to control priority of ports
   having identical port cost. (See above).
 </dd>
