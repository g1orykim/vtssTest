	* threadload_update() now only takes one argument, which is the ID
	  of the next thread. The previous thread's ID is cached within the
	  the thread module. ID == 0 (which is otherwise invalid) is now
	  used for DSR context load (this has only caused changes in sched.cxx).

	* Created a new package for measuring per-thread CPU loads.
	  This has impact on the scheduler's task-switching time, so
	  use with care.
