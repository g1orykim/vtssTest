 <dt>Server Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the server mode operation.
 When the mode operation is enabled, the syslog message will send out to syslog server.
 The syslog protocol is based on UDP communication and received on UDP port 514 
 and the syslog server will not send acknowledgments back sender since UDP is a
 connectionless protocol and it does not provide acknowledgments. The syslog
 packet will always send out even if the syslog server does not exist.
 Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable server mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable server mode operation.
