<h1>Private VLAN Membership Configuration Help</h1>

<p>The <a href="glossary.htm#private_vlan" class="glossary">Private VLAN</a> membership configurations for the switch can be
monitored and modified here. Private <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a>s can be added or deleted
here. Port members of each Private VLAN can be added or
removed here.
</p>

<p>Private VLANs are based on the source port mask, and there are no
connections to VLANs. This means that <a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a>s and Private VLAN IDs
can be identical.</p>

<p>A port must be a member of both a VLAN and a Private VLAN to be able
to forward packets. By default, all ports are VLAN unaware and members
of VLAN 1 and Private VLAN 1.</p>

<p>A VLAN unaware port can only be a member of one VLAN, but it can be
a member of multiple Private VLANs.</p>

<!-- PVLANs should never be compiled into stackable images, but if they are then make sure that users get to know about it -->
<p class="SPOM_only">Private VLANs do not work across the stack.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd>

 To delete a private VLAN entry, check this box. The entry will be deleted during the next save.
 </dd>

 <dt>Private VLAN ID</dt>
 <dd>

 Indicates the ID of this particular private VLAN.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port Members</dt>
 <dd>

 A row of check boxes for each port is displayed for each private VLAN ID. To include a port in a Private VLAN, check the box. To remove or exclude the port from the Private VLAN, make sure the box is unchecked. By default, no ports are members, and all boxes are unchecked.

 </dd>
 <dt>Adding a New Private VLAN</dt>
 <dd>

Click <input type="button" value=" Add New Private VLAN "> to add a
new private VLAN ID. An empty row is added to the table, and the
private VLAN can be configured as needed. The allowed range for a
private VLAN ID is the same as the switch port number range. Any
values outside this range are not accepted, and a warning message
appears. Click "OK" to discard the incorrect entry, or click "Cancel"
to return to the editing and make a correction.

<p>The Private VLAN is enabled when you click "Save".</p>
 
<p>The <input type="button" value=" Delete "> button can be used to
undo the addition of new Private VLANs.</p>
