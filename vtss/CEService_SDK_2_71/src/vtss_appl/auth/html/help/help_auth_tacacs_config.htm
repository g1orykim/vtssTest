    <h1>TACACS+ Server Configuration Help</h1>
    <p>
      This page allows you to configure the <a href="glossary.htm#radius" class="glossary">TACACS+</a> servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Global Configuration</h2>
    These setting are common for all of the TACACS+ servers.
    <dl>
      <dt>Timeout</dt>
      <dd>
        Timeout is the number of seconds, in the range <span class="AuthTimeoutMin">?</span> to <span class="AuthTimeoutMax">?</span>,
        to wait for a reply from a TACACS+ server before it is considered to be dead.
      </dd>
      <dt>Deadtime</dt>
      <dd>
        Deadtime, which can be set to a number between <span class="AuthDeadtimeMin">?</span> to <span class="AuthDeadtimeMax">?</span> minutes,
        is the period during which the switch will not send new requests to a server that has failed to respond to a previous request.
        This will stop the switch from continually trying to contact a server that it has already determined as dead.<br/>
        Setting the Deadtime to a value greater than 0 (zero) will enable this feature, but only if more than one server has been configured.
      </dd>
      <dt>Key</dt>
      <dd>
        The secret key - up to <span class="AuthKeyLen">?</span> characters long - shared between the TACACS+ server and the switch.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Server Configuration</h2>
    The table has one row for each TACACS+ server and a number of columns, which are:
    <dl>
      <dt>Delete</dt>
      <dd>
        To delete a TACACS+ server entry, check this box. The entry will be deleted during the next Save.
      </dd>
      <dt>Hostname</dt>
      <dd>
        The IP address<span class="has_dns"> or hostname</span> of the TACACS+ server.
      </dd>
      <dt>Port</dt>
      <dd>
        The <a href="glossary.htm#tcp" class="glossary">TCP</a> port to use on the TACACS+ server for authentication.
      </dd>
      <dt>Timeout</dt>
      <dd>
        This optional setting overrides the global timeout value. Leaving it blank will use the global timeout value.
      </dd>
      <dt>Key</dt>
      <dd>
        This optional setting overrides the global key. Leaving it blank will use the global key.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Adding a New Server</h2>
    <p>
      Click <input type="button" value=" Add New Server "> to add a new TACACS+ server. An empty row is added
      to the table, and the TACACS+ server can be configured as needed. Up to <span class="AuthServerCnt">?</span> servers are supported.<br/>
      The <input type="button" value=" Delete "> button can be used to undo the addition of the new server.
    </p>

    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <p><input type="button" value=" Save ">: Click to save changes.</p>
    <p><input type="button" value=" Reset ">: Click to undo any changes made locally and revert to previously saved values.</p>
