<h1>Port Power Savings Configuration Help</h1>

 <p>This page allows the user to configure the port power savings features.</p>

<h2 class="EEE">What is EEE</h2>
<p><a href="glossary.htm#EEE" class="glossary">EEE</a> is a power saving option that reduces the power usage when there is low or no traffic utilization.</p>

<p><a href="glossary.htm#EEE" class="glossary">EEE</a> works by powering down circuits when there is no traffic. When a
port gets data to be transmitted all circuits are powered up. The time
it takes to power up the circuits is named wakeup time. The default
wakeup time is 17 us for 1Gbit links and 30 us for other link speeds. <a href="glossary.htm#EEE" class="glossary">EEE</a> devices must agree upon the
value of the wakeup time in order to make sure that both the receiving and transmitting device
has all circuits powered up when traffic is transmitted. The devices can exchange wakeup time
information using the <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> protocol.</p>

<p><a href="glossary.htm#EEE" class="glossary">EEE</a> works for ports in auto-negotiation mode, where the port is negotiated to either 1G or 100 Mbit full duplex mode.</p>
<p>For ports that are not EEE-capable the corresponding EEE checkboxes are grayed out and thus impossible to enable <a href="glossary.htm#EEE" class="glossary">EEE</a> for.</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The <a href="glossary.htm#EEE" class="glossary">EEE</a> port settings relate to the currently selected stack unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<p>When a port is powered down for saving power, outgoing traffic is
stored in a buffer until the port is powered up again. Because there are
some overhead in turning the port down and up, more power can be saved
if the traffic can be buffered up until a large burst of traffic can be
transmitted. Buffering traffic will give some latency in the traffic. </p>

<h2 class="EEE_OPTIMIZE_SUPPORT">Optimize EEE for</h2>
  <p class="EEE_OPTIMIZE_SUPPORT">The switch can be set to optimize EEE
  for either best power saving or least traffic latency.</p>

 <p>Link down power savings enabled.</p>

 <p> ActiPHY works by lowering the power for a port when there is no
link. The port is power up for short moment in order to determine if
cable is inserted.</p>
 </dd>

 <dt class="PHY_PWR_CTRL">PerfectReach</dt>
 <dd class="PHY_PWR_CTRL">
 <p>Cable length power savings enabled.</p>

  <p> PerfectReach works by determining the cable length and lowering the
power for ports with short cables.</p>

 <p class="EEE_HAS_URGENT_QUEUES">For maximizing power savings, the circuit isn't started at once transmit data is ready for
a port, but is instead queued until a burst of data is ready to be
transmitted. This will give some traffic latency.</p>

 <p class="EEE_HAS_URGENT_QUEUES">If desired it is possible to minimize the latency for specific
frames, by mapping the frames to a specific queue (done with QOS), and
then mark the queue as an urgent queue. When an urgent queue gets data
to be transmitted, the circuits will be powered up at once and the
latency will be reduced to the wakeup time.</p>

</dd>
 <dt class="EEE_HAS_URGENT_QUEUES">EEE Urgent Queues</dt>
 <dd class="EEE_HAS_URGENT_QUEUES">Queues set will activate transmission of frames as soon as data is
 available. Otherwise the queue will postpone transmission until a burst
 of frames can be transmitted.
