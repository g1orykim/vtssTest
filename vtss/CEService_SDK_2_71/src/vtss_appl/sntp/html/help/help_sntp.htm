<h2>SNTP Configuration</h2>

<p>Configure SNTP on this page.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNTP mode operation. Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable SNTP client mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable SNTP client mode operation.
 </dd>

 <dt>Server Address</dt>
 <dd> 
 Provide the IPv4 or IPv6 address of a SNTP server. IPv6 address is in 128-bit records represented as eight fields of up to four hexadecimal digits with a colon separating each field (:).
 For example, 'fe80::215:c5ff:fe03:4dc7'.
 The symbol '::' is a special syntax that can be used as a shorthand way of representing multiple 16-bit groups of contiguous zeros; but it can appear only once. It can also represent a legally valid IPv4 address. For example, '::192.1.2.34'.
