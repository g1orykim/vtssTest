# This file defines the options that the NAS module can be compiled with.

# RADIUS-assigned QoS:
# Choose at most *one* of the following two defines
# When either one is defined, VTSS_SW_OPTION_NAS_BACKEND_ASSIGNED_QOS will automatically
# become defined. Please refer to .../vtss_appl/nas/platform/dot1x.c for differences between
# the following two (or alternatively .../vtss_appl/web/html/help/help_nas.htm)
# For VTSS_SW_OPTION_NAS_BACKEND_ASSIGNED_QOS_CUSTOM, please refer to
#   .../vtss_appl/nas/platform/nas_qos_custom_api.h for additional information
# about how to define your own RADIUS attributes used to identify the QoS class.

# RADIUS-assigned VLAN:
# Define the following if you want RADIUS-assigned VLAN to be
# available in the image:

# Guest VLAN:
# Define the following if you want Guest VLAN functionality
# available in the image. A port that is in
# Port-based, Single-, or Multi- 802.1X mode will be put
# in the Guest VLAN if no EAPOL frames are received
# within a number of Request Identity retries, and
# taken out immediately if an EAPOL frame is received,
# unless configured not to (Disregard EAPOL History).
