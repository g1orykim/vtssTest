<h1>DHCP Relay Configuration Help</h1>

<h2><a href="glossary.htm#dhcp_relay" class="glossary">DHCP Relay</a> Configuration</h2>

<p>A DHCP relay agent is used to forward and to transfer DHCP messages between the clients and the server when they are not in the same subnet domain.
   It stores the incoming interface IP address in the GIADDR field of the DHCP packet.
   The DHCP server can use the value of GIADDR field to determine the assigned subnet.
   For such condition, please make sure the switch configuration of VLAN interface IP address and PVID(Port VLAN ID) correctly.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Relay Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the DHCP relay mode operation.
 <br>Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable DHCP relay mode operation. When DHCP relay mode operation is enabled, the agent forwards and transfers DHCP messages between the clients and the server when they are not in the same subnet domain. And the DHCP broadcast message won't be flooded for security considerations. 
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable DHCP relay mode operation.
 </dd>

 <dt>Relay Server</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the DHCP relay server <a href="glossary.htm#ip" class="glossary">IP</a> address.
 </dd>

 <dt>Relay Information Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the DHCP relay information mode option operation.
 The option 82 circuit ID format as "[vlan_id][module_id][port_no]".
 The first four characters represent the VLAN ID, the fifth and sixth
 characters are the module ID(in standalone device it always equal 0, 
 in stackable device it means switch ID), and the last two characters
 are the port number. For example, "00030108" means the DHCP message 
 receive form VLAN ID 3, switch ID 1, port No 8. And the option 82
 remote ID value is equal the switch MAC address.
 <br>Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable DHCP relay information mode operation. When DHCP relay information mode operation is enabled, the agent inserts specific information (option 82) into a DHCP message when forwarding to DHCP server and removes it from a DHCP message when transferring to DHCP client. It only works when DHCP relay operation mode is enabled.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable DHCP relay information mode operation.
 </dd>

 <dt>Relay Information Policy</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the DHCP relay information option policy.
 When DHCP relay information mode operation is enabled, if the agent receives
 a DHCP message that already contains relay agent information it will enforce
 the policy. The 'Replace' policy is invalid when relay information mode is disabled.
 Possible policies are:
 <br><samp>Replace</samp>: Replace the original relay information when a DHCP message that already contains it is received. 
 <br><samp>Keep</samp>: Keep the original relay information when a DHCP message that already contains it is received. 
 <br><samp>Drop</samp>: Drop the package when a DHCP message that already contains relay information is received. 
 </dd>
