<h1>Dynamic DHCP snooping Table</h1>

<p>
  This page display the dynamic IP assigned information after DHCP Snooping mode is disabled.
  All DHCP clients obtained the dynamic IP address from the DHCP server will be listed in this table except for local VLAN interface IP addresses.
  Entries in the Dynamic DHCP snooping Table are shown on this page.
</p>

<h2> Navigating the DHCP snooping Table</h2>
<p>
  Each page shows up to 99 entries from the Dynamic DHCP snooping table, default being 20, selected through the
  "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries from
  the beginning of the Dynamic DHCP snooping Table.<br/>
  The "MAC address" and "VLAN" input fields allows the user to select the starting point in the Dynamic DHCP snooping Table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the closest next Dynamic DHCP snooping Table match. In addition, the two input fields will -
  upon a <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button click - assume the value of the first displayed entry,
  allowing for continuous refresh with the same start address.<br/>
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed table as a basis for
  the next lookup. When the end is reached the text "No more entries" is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.
</p>
