<h1>Group Name to VLAN mapping Table Help</h1>

<p>This page allows you to map a already configured Group Name to a <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a> for the <span class="SPOM_only"> selected stack switch unit </span><span class="Standalone_only"> switch </span>.</p>

<p>The displayed settings are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd>To delete a Group Name to VLAN map entry, check this box. The entry will be deleted on the switch during the next Save</dd>
 <dt >Group Name</dt>
 <dd>A valid Group Name is a string at the most 16 characters which consists of a combination of alphabets (a-z or A-Z) and integers(0-9), no special character is allowed.
     whichever Group name you try map to a VLAN must be present in Protocol to Group mapping table and must not be pre-used by any other existing mapping entry on this page.</dd>
 <dt><a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a></dt>
 <dd>Indicates the ID to which Group Name will be mapped. A valid VLAN ID ranges from 1-4095.</dd>
<dt>Port Members</dt>
 <dd>
  A row of check boxes for each port is displayed for each Group Name to VLAN ID mapping. To include a port in a mapping,
  check the box. To remove or exclude the port from the mapping, make sure the box is unchecked.
  By default, no ports are members, and all boxes are unchecked.
 </dd>
 <dt>Adding a New Group to VLAN mapping entry</dt>
 <dd>
   Click <input type="button" value=" Add New Entry "> to add a new entry in mapping table. An empty row is added
   to the table, the Group Name, VLAN ID and port members can be configured as needed. Legal values for a VLAN ID are
   <samp>1</samp> through <samp>4095</samp>.<br/><br/>
   The <input type="button" value=" Delete "> button can be used to undo the addition of new entry.
   The maximum possible Group to VLAN mappings are limited to 64.
