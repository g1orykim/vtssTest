        <h1>DHCP Server Mode Configuration Help</h1>

        <h2><a href="glossary.htm#dhcp_server" class="glossary">DHCP Server</a> Mode Configuration</h2>

        <p>
            This page configures global mode and VLAN mode to enable/disable DHCP server per system and per VLAN.
        </p>

        <h2>Global Mode</h2>
        <p>Configure operation mode to enable/disable DHCP server per system.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Mode</dt>
            <dd>
                Configure the operation mode per system. Possible modes are:
                <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable DHCP server per system.
                <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable DHCP server pre system.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>VLAN Mode</h2>
        <p>Configure operation mode to enable/disable DHCP server per VLAN.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>VLAN Range</dt>
            <dd>
                Indicate the VLAN range in which DHCP server is enabled or disabled.
                The first VLAN ID must be smaller than or equal to the second VLAN ID.
                BUT, if the VLAN range contains only 1 VLAN ID, then you can just input
                it into either one of the first and second VLAN ID or both.
                <br>On the other hand, if you want to disable existed VLAN range, then you can follow the steps.
                <br>1. press <input type="button" value=" Add VLAN Range "> to add a new VLAN range.
                <br>2. input the VLAN range that you want to disable.
                <br>3. choose Mode to be <samp>Disabled</samp>.
                <br>4. press <input type="button" value=" Save "> to apply the change.
                <br>
                <br>Then, you will see the disabled VLAN range is removed from the DHCP Server mode configuration page.
            </dd>

            <dt>Mode</dt>
            <dd>
                Indicate the the operation mode per VLAN. Possible modes are:
                <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable DHCP server per VLAN.
                <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable DHCP server pre VLAN.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Buttons</h2>
        <p><input type="button" value=" Add VLAN Range ">: Click to add a new VLAN range.</p>
        <br>
        <p><input type="button" value=" Save ">: Click to save changes.</p>
