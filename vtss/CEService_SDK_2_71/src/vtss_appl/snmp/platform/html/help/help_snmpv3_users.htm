<h1>SNMPv3 User Configuration Help</h1>

<h2><a href="glossary.htm#snmp" class="glossary">SNMP</a>v3 User Configuration</h2>

<p>Configure SNMPv3 user table on this page. The entry index keys are <samp>Engine ID</samp> and <samp>User Name</samp>.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd>
 Check to delete the entry. It will be deleted during the next save.
 </dd>

 <dt>Engine ID</dt>
 <dd>
 An octet string identifying the engine ID that this entry should belong to.
 The string must contain an even number(in hexadecimal format) with number of digits between 10 and 64, but all-zeros and all-'F's are not allowed.
 The SNMPv3 architecture uses the User-based Security Model (USM) for message security
 and the View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for access control.
 For the USM entry, the usmUserEngineID and usmUserName are the entry's keys.
 In a simple agent, usmUserEngineID is always that agent's own snmpEngineID value.
 The value can also take the value of the snmpEngineID of a remote SNMP engine
 with which this user can communicate.
 In other words, if user engine ID equal system engine ID then it is local user; otherwise it's remote user.
 </dd>

 <dt>User Name</dt>
 <dd>
 A string identifying the user name that this entry should belong to.
 The allowed string length is 1 to 32, and the allowed content is ASCII characters from 33 to 126.
 </dd>

 <dt>Security Level</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the security model that this entry should belong to. Possible security models are:
 <br><samp>NoAuth, NoPriv</samp>: No authentication and no privacy.
 <br><samp>Auth, NoPriv</samp>: Authentication and no privacy.
 <br><samp>Auth, Priv</samp>: Authentication and privacy.
 <br>The value of security level cannot be modified if entry already exists. That means it must first be ensured that the value is set correctly.
 </dd>

 <dt>Authentication Protocol</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the authentication protocol that this entry should belong to. Possible authentication protocols are:
 <br><samp>None</samp>: No authentication protocol.
 <br><samp><a href="glossary.htm#md5" class="glossary">MD5</a></samp>: An optional flag to indicate that this user uses MD5 authentication protocol.
 <br><samp><a href="glossary.htm#sha" class="glossary">SHA</a></samp>: An optional flag to indicate that this user uses SHA authentication protocol.
 <br>The value of security level cannot be modified if entry already exists. That means must first ensure that the value is set correctly.
 </dd>

 <dt>Authentication Password</dt>
 <dd>
 A string identifying the authentication password phrase.
 For MD5 authentication protocol, the allowed string length is 8 to 32.
 For SHA authentication protocol, the allowed string length is 8 to 40.
 The allowed content is ASCII characters from 33 to 126.
 </dd>

 <dt>Privacy Protocol</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the privacy protocol that this entry should belong to. Possible privacy protocols are:
 <br><samp>None</samp>: No privacy protocol.
 <br><samp><a href="glossary.htm#des" class="glossary">DES</a></samp>: An optional flag to indicate that this user uses DES authentication protocol.
 <br><samp><a href="glossary.htm#aes" class="glossary">AES</a></samp>: An optional flag to indicate that this user uses AES authentication protocol.
 </dd>

 <dt>Privacy Password</dt>
 <dd>
 A string identifying the privacy password phrase.
 The allowed string length is 8 to 32, and the allowed content is ASCII characters from 33 to 126.
 </dd>
</dl>
