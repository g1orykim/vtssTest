<h2>Loop Back</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Enable</dt>

 </dd>
 <dt>Rate</dt>
 <dd>
 The TST frame transmission bit rate - in Mega bits pr. second. Limit on Caracal is 400 Mbps. Limit on Serval is 1Gbps.

 <dd>
 The TST frame size. This is entered as the wanted size (in bytes) of a un-tagged frame containing TST OAM PDU - including CRC (four bytes).
 <p> Example when 'Size' = 64  =>  Un-tagged frame size = DMAC(6) + SMAC(6) + TYPE(2) + TST PDU LENGTH(46) + CRC(4) = 64 bytes </p>
 <p> The transmitted frame will be four bytes longer for each tag added - 8 bytes in case of a tunnel EVC. </p>
 <p> Minimum Size is 64 Bytes. Maximum Size is 9600 Bytes </p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Pattern</dt>
 <dd>
 The 'empty' TST PDU has the size of 12 bytes. In order to achieve the configured frame size a data TLV will be added with a pattern.
 <p> Example when 'Size' = 64  =>  Un-tagged frame size = DMAC(6) + SMAC(6) + TYPE(2) + TST PDU LENGTH(46) + CRC(4) = 64 bytes </p>
 <p> The TST PDU needs to be 46 bytes so a pattern of 46-12=34 bytes will be added. </p>
 <p><b>All Zero:</b>  Pattern will be '00000000'</p>
 <p><b>All One:</b>   Pattern will be '11111111'</p>
