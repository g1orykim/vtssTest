<h2>SNMP Trap Detailed Configuration</h2>

<p>Configure SNMP trap on this page.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Trap Config Name</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates which trap Configuration's name for configuring. The allowed string length is 0 to 255, and the allowed content is ASCII characters from 33 to 126.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP mode operation. Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable SNMP mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable SNMP mode operation.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Version</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP supported version. Possible versions are:
 <br><samp>SNMP v1</samp>: Set SNMP supported version 1.
 <br><samp>SNMP v2c</samp>: Set SNMP supported version 2c.
 </dd>
 <dd class="SNMPV3_CTRL"><samp>SNMP v3</samp>: Set SNMP supported version 3.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Community</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the community access string when sending SNMP trap packet. The allowed string length is 0 to 255, and the allowed content is ASCII characters from 33 to 126. 
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Destination Address</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP trap destination address. It allow a valid IP address in dotted decimal notation ('x.y.z.w').
 </dd>
 <dd class="has_dns">
 And it also allow a valid hostname.
 A valid hostname is a string drawn from the alphabet (A-Za-z), digits (0-9), dot (.), dash (-).
 Spaces are not allowed, the first character must be an alpha character, and the first and last characters must not be a dot or a dash.
 </dd>

 <dd class="has_ipv6">
 Indicates the SNMP trap destination IPv6 address. IPv6 address is in 128-bit records represented as eight fields of up to four hexadecimal digits with a colon separating each field (:).
 For example, 'fe80::215:c5ff:fe03:4dc7'.
 The symbol '::' is a special syntax that can be used as a shorthand way of representing multiple 16-bit groups of contiguous zeros; but it can appear only once.
 It can also represent a legally valid IPv4 address. For example, '::192.1.2.34'.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Destination port</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP trap destination port. SNMP Agent will send SNMP message via this port, the port range is 1~65535.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Inform Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP trap inform mode operation. Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable SNMP trap inform mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable SNMP trap inform mode operation.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Inform Timeout (seconds)</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP trap inform timeout.
 The allowed range is <samp>0</samp> to <samp>2147</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Inform Retry Times</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP trap inform retry times.
 The allowed range is <samp>0</samp> to <samp>255</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt class="SNMPV3_CTRL">Trap Probe Security Engine ID</dt>
 <dd class="SNMPV3_CTRL">
 Indicates the SNMP trap probe security engine ID mode of operation. Possible values are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable SNMP trap probe security engine ID mode of operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable SNMP trap probe security engine ID mode of operation.
 </dd>

 <dt class="SNMPV3_CTRL">Trap Security Engine ID</dt>
 <dd class="SNMPV3_CTRL">
 Indicates the SNMP trap security engine ID.
 SNMPv3 sends traps and informs using USM for authentication and privacy. A unique engine ID
 for these traps and informs is needed. When "Trap Probe Security Engine ID" is enabled,
 the ID will be probed automatically. Otherwise, the ID specified in this field is used.
 The string must contain an even number(in hexadecimal format) with number of digits between 10 and 64, but all-zeros and all-'F's are not allowed.
 </dd>

 <dt class="SNMPV3_CTRL">Trap Security Name</dt>
 <dd class="SNMPV3_CTRL">
 Indicates the SNMP trap security name.
 SNMPv3 traps and informs using USM for authentication and privacy. A unique security
 name is needed when traps and informs are enabled.
