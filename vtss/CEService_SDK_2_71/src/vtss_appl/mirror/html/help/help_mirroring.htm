<h1>Mirroring Configuration Help</h1>

<p>Configure port <a href="glossary.htm#mirroring" class="glossary">Mirroring</a> on this page.</p>


<p>To debug network problems, selected traffic can be copied, or mirrored, on a <b>mirror port</b> where a frame analyzer can be attached to analyze the frame flow.</p>
<p>The traffic to be copied on the <b>mirror port</b> is selected as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> All frames received on a given port (also known as ingress or source mirroring).</li>
<li> All frames transmitted on a given port (also known as egress or destination mirroring).</li>
</ul>



<h2>Port to mirror to</h2>

<p><b>Port to mirror</b> also known as the <b>mirror port</b>. Frames from ports that have
  either source (rx) or destination (tx) mirroring
enabled are mirrored on this port. <samp>Disabled</samp> disables mirroring.</p>

<div class="SPOM_only">
<h2>Switch to mirror to </h2>

<p>Frames from ports that have either source (rx) or destination (tx) mirroring enabled are mirrored to this switch.</p>

</div>

<h2>Mirror Port Configuration</h2>

<p>The following table is used for Rx and Tx enabling.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>

 The logical port for the settings contained in the same row.
 </dd>

 <dt>Mode</dt>
 <dd>
  Select mirror mode.
  <br><samp>Rx only</samp>  Frames received on this port are mirrored on the <b>mirror port</b>. Frames transmitted are not mirrored.
  <br><samp>Tx only</samp>  Frames transmitted on this port are mirrored on the <b>mirror port</b>. Frames received are not mirrored.
  <br><samp>Disabled</samp> Neither frames transmitted nor frames received are mirrored.
  <br><samp>Enabled</samp>  Frames received and frames transmitted are mirrored on the <b>mirror port</b>.

 </dd>
 <dd>
 Note: For a given port, a frame is only transmitted once. It is
 therefore not possible to mirror <b>mirror port</b> Tx frames.
 Because of this, <b>mode</b> for the selected <b>mirror port</b> is limited to <samp>Disabled</samp> 
 or <samp>Rx only</samp>.
 </dd>
