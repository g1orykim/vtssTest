<h1>VCL IP Subnet-based VLAN Configuration Help</h1>

<p>
  The IP subnet-based VLAN entries can be configured here. This page allows for adding, updating and deleting IP subnet-based VLAN
  entries and assigning the entries to different ports. This page shows only static entries.
</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd >
  To delete a IP subnet-based VLAN entry, check this box and press save. The entry will be deleted <span class="SPOM_only">on
  the selected switch </span> in the stack.
 </dd>

 <dt>VCE ID</dt>
 <dd>
  Indicates the index of the entry. It is user configurable. It's value ranges from 0-128. If a VCE ID is 0, application will
  auto-generate the VCE ID for that entry. Deletion and lookup of IP subnet-based VLAN are based on VCE ID.
 </dd>

 <dt>IP Address</dt>
 <dd>
  Indicates the IP address.
 </dd>

 <dt>Mask Length</dt>
 <dd>
  Indicates the network mask length.
 </dd>

 <dt>VLAN ID</dt>
 <dd>
  Indicates the VLAN ID. VLAN ID can be changed for the existing entries.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port Members</dt>
 <dd>
  A row of check boxes for each port is displayed for each IP subnet-based VLAN entry. To include a port in
  a IP subnet-based VLAN, check the box. To remove or exclude the port from the IP subnet-based VLAN, make sure the 
  box is unchecked. By default, no ports are members, and all boxes are unchecked.
 </dd>

 <dt>Adding a New IP subnet-based VLAN</dt>
 <dd>
   Click <input type="button" value=" Add New Entry "> to add a new IP subnet-based VLAN entry. An empty row 
   is added to the table, and the IP subnet-based VLAN entry can be configured as needed. Any IP address/mask 
   can be configured for the IP subnet-based VLAN entry.
   Legal values for a VLAN ID are <samp>1</samp> through <samp>4095</samp>.<br/><br/>
   The IP subnet-based VLAN entry is enabled <span class="SPOM_only">on the selected stack switch unit</span> 
   when you click on "Save".
   The <input type="button" value=" Delete "> button can be used to undo the addition of new IP subnet-based VLANs.
   The maximum possible IP subnet-based VLAN entries are limited to 128.
 </dd>
