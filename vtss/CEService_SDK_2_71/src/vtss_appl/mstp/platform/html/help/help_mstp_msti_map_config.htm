<h1>STP MSTI Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect the
current <a href="glossary.htm#rstp" class="glossary">STP</a> MSTI
bridge instance priority configurations, and possibly change them as
well.</p>

<fieldset>
 <legend>Configuration Identification</legend>
 <dl>
  <dt>Configuration Name</dt>
  <dd>
   The name identifying the VLAN to MSTI mapping. Bridges must share
   the name and revision (see below), as well as the VLAN-to-MSTI
   mapping configuration in order to share spanning trees for
   MSTI's (Intra-region). The name is at most 32 characters.
  </dd>
  <dt>Configuration Revision</dt>
  <dd>
   The revision of the MSTI configuration named above. This must be an
   integer between 0 and 65535.
  </dd>
</dl>

</fieldset>

<fieldset>
 <legend>MSTI Mapping</legend>
 <dl>
  <dt>MSTI</dt>
  <dd>
    The bridge instance. The CIST is not available for explicit
    mapping, as it will receive the VLANs not explicitly mapped.
  </dd>
  <dt>VLANs Mapped</dt>
  <dd>
   The list of VLANs mapped to the MSTI. The VLANs can be given as a
   single (<samp>xx</samp>, xx being between 1 and 4094) VLAN, or a
   range (<samp>xx-yy</samp>), each of which must be separated with
   comma and/or space. A VLAN can only be mapped to <em>one</em>
   MSTI. An unused MSTI should just be left empty. (I.e. not having
   any VLANs mapped to it.) Example: <samp>2,5,20-40</samp>.
