<h1> MEP Performance Monitor Configuration Help</h1>

<p> This page allows the user to inspect and configure the performance monitor of the current <a href="glossary.htm#MEP" class="glossary">MEP</a> Instance.</p>

 </dd>
 <dt>Near End Loss Ratio</dt>
 <dd>

 The result is given in percent.
 </dd>
 <dt>Far End Loss Ratio</dt>
 <dd>
 The far end frame loss ratio calculated based on the far end frame loss count and near end frame transmitted - in the latest 'FLR Interval'.
 The result is given in percent.
 </dd>
 <dt>Clear</dt>
 <dd>
 Set of this check and save will clear the accumulated counters and restart ratio calculation.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Delay Measurement</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Enable</dt>
 <dd>
 Delay Measurement based on transmitting 1DM/DMM PDU can be enabled/disabled.
 Delay Measurement based on receiving and handling 1DM/DMR PDU is always enabled.
 </dd>
 <dt>Priority</dt>
 <dd>
 The priority to be inserted as PCP bits in TAG (if any).
 </dd>
 <dt>Cast</dt>
 <dd>
 Selection of 1DM/DMM PDU transmitted unicast or multicast. The unicast MAC will be configured through 'Peer MEP'.
 </dd>
 <dt>Peer MEP</dt>
 <dd>
 This is only used if the 'Cast' is configured to Uni.
 The 1DM/DMR unicast MAC will be taken from the 'Unicast Peer MAC' configuration of this peer.
 </dd>
 <dt>Way</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>One-Way:</b> One-Way Delay Measurement implemented on 1DM.</p>
 <p><b>Two-Way:</b> Two-Way Delay Measurement implemented on DMM/DMR.</p>

 <dt>Tx Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>Standardize:</b> Y.1731 standardize way to transmit 1DM/DMR.</p>
 <p><b>Proprietary:</b> Vitesse proprietary way with follow-up packets to transmit 1DM/DMR.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Calc</dt>
 <dd>
 This is only used if the 'Way' is configured to Two-way.
 <p><b>Round trip:</b> The frame delay calculated by the transmitting and receiving timestamps of initiators. Frame Delay = RxTimeb-TxTimeStampf</p>
 <p><b>Flow:</b> The frame delay calculated by the transmitting and receiving timestamps of initiators and remotes. Frame Delay = (RxTimeb-TxTimeStampf)-(TxTimeStampb-RxTimeStampf)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Gap</dt>
 <dd>
 The gap between transmitting 1DM/DMM PDU in 10ms. The range is 10 to 65535.
 </dd>
 <dt>Count</dt>
 <dd>
 The number of last records to calculate. The range is 10 to 2000.
 </dd>
 <dt>Unit</dt>
 <dd>

 </dd>
 <dt>D2forD1</dt>
 <dd>
 Enable to use DMM/DMR packet to calculate one-way DM.
 If the option is enabled, the following action will be taken.
 When DMR is received, two-way delay (roundtrip or flow) and both near-end-to-far-end and far-end-to-near-end one-way delay are calculated.
 When DMM or 1DM is received, only far-end-to-near-end one-way delay is calculated.

 </dd>
