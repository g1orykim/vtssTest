 - critical bugfix from Adam Liss - 
   The problem is that tac_close() is called by both catchup() and tac_abort()
   when tac_connect() times out.  And tac_close() tries to free(session) both
   times because it cannot clear the pointer to NULL after its memory is freed.

 - make Makefile, rename libtacacs.h to libtacplus.h

  - add utility tac_perftest in samples dir - this is authentication/authorization
    stress testing utility

  - fixes with session_id again - i fix bug with incorrect session_id
    conversion, this bug can create problems with
	  tacacs+ server which are working in single connection mode.

  Thanks Vladimir Sekissov for several updates:
	- in tac_authen_get_reply - do not read session_id again,
		this is not single mode and session id doesn't change during session
	- add flag set in header of accounting packet (i have missed it)

    Add patch from Ben Gras <ben@euro.net>:

This is message from his mail:

First of all, tac_authen.c could do with a little more error checking
(I made a bug in a tacacs+ server which caused this piece of code to
crash)
Now the following is fairly straightforward, but I thought it was pretty
important to include the failure message in the error. Also it corrects a
bug involving alarm() - if the connect() fails, alarm() isn't reset and
causes process to die it it's still running after the timeout. The message
change is a silly change of mine, I don't like allcaps. The strerror(errno)
is rather more portable than sys_errlist[errno].

    Makefile fixes from Lazaro.Lopez_Mercado@alcatel.es
    + added Makefile.2 for use with Solaris (or may be some other makes)

    Add patch from Michael Mraka (Michael.Mraka@GTSgroup.cz)
    about correct handling connect timeouts (big thanks for
    my ugly code cleanups)

    Add archieve tacNT.zip with changed sources for working with NT
    (great thanks to Dennis Day dennisday@columbus.rr.com)
    Hope, I'll merge it with main tree.

    Code cleanups from kissg@sztaki.hu
