<h1>Detailed Link OAM Port Statistics Help</h1>

<p>This page provides detailed OAM traffic statistics for a specific switch port. 
Use the port select box to select which switch port details to display.</p>

<p>The displayed counters represent the total number of OAM frames received and transmitted for the selected port.
   Discontinuities of these counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system.</p>

<h2>Receive Total and Transmit Total</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>Rx and Tx OAM Information PDU's</dt>
 <dd>
 The number of received and transmitted OAM Information PDU's. Discontinuities of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Unique Error Event Notification</dt>
 <dd>
     A count of the number of unique Event OAMPDUs received and transmitted on
     this interface.  Event Notifications may be sent in duplicate
     to increase the probability of successfully being received,
     given the possibility that a frame may be lost in transit.
     Duplicate Event Notification transmissions are counted by
     Duplicate Event Notification counters for Tx and Rx respectively.
     A unique Event Notification OAMPDU is indicated as an Event
     Notification OAMPDU with a Sequence Number field that is
     distinct from the previously transmitted Event Notification
     OAMPDU Sequence Number.
     
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Duplicate Error Event Notification</dt>
 <dd>
     A count of the number of duplicate Event OAMPDUs received and transmitted
     on this interface.  Event Notification OAMPDUs may be sent in
     duplicate to increase the probability of successfully being
     received, given the possibility that a frame may be lost in
     transit.
     A duplicate Event Notification OAMPDU is indicated as an Event
     Notification OAMPDU with a Sequence Number field that is
     identical to the previously transmitted Event Notification
     OAMPDU Sequence Number.     
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Loopback Control</dt>
 <dd>
 A count of the number of Loopback Control OAMPDUs received and transmitted
 on this interface.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Variable Request</dt>
 <dd>
 A count of the number of Variable Request OAMPDUs received and transmitted
 on this interface.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Variable Response</dt>
 <dd>
 A count of the number of Variable Response OAMPDUs
received and transmitted on this interface.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Org Specific PDU's</dt>
 <dd>
  A count of the number of Organization Specific OAMPDUs
  transmitted on this interface.
 </dd>

<dt>Rx and Tx Unsupported Codes </dt>
<dd>
 A count of the number of OAMPDUs transmitted on this
 interface with an unsupported op-code.
</dd>
<dt>Rx and Tx Link fault PDU's </dt>
<dd>
 A count of the number of Link fault PDU's received and transmitted on this
 interface.
</dd>
<dt>Rx and Tx Dying Gasp </dt>
<dd>
 A count of the number of Dying Gasp events received and transmitted on this
 interface.
</dd>
<dt>Rx and Tx Critical Event PDU's </dt>
<dd>
 A count of the number of Critical event PDU's  received and transmitted on this
 interface.
</dd>
</dl>
