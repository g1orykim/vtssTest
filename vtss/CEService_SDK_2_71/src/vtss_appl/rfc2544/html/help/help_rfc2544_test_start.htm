<h1>RFC2544 Test Start Help</h1>

<p>
  This page allows for initiating execution of a profile while naming and describing the resulting report.
  Once a test is started, a snap-shot of the chosen profile is made, so that subsequent changes in the
  profile editor won't be reflected in the running test.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Report Name</dt>
  <dd>
    Each test report must have a name that uniquely identifies it, since it is this name that identifies it in the non-volatile file system.<br/>
    The length must be from 1 to 32 characters with each ASCII character being in the range [33; 126].
  </dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    This field allows for providing a textual description of the report. Up to 128 characters can be entered.
  </dd>

  <dt>Profile</dt>
  <dd>
    Select the profile to execute. The drop-down box is populated with the names of the currently defined profiles. If no profiles are defined, the text &quot;&lt;No Profiles&gt;&quot; is displayed.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><input type="button" value=" Run ">: If all input parameters are valid, the test will start executing and you will be returned to the RFC2544 Report Overview page.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Cancel ">: Return to the RFC2544 Report Overview page without initiating a new test.</p>
