<h1>Storm Control Configuration Help</h1>

<p>Storm control for the switch is configured on this page.</p>

<p>
There is a unicast storm rate control, multicast storm rate control, and a broadcast storm rate control. These only affect flooded frames, i.e. frames with a (VLAN ID, DMAC) pair not present on the MAC Address table.
<br>The configuration indicates the permitted packet rate for unicast, multicast or broadcast traffic across the switch.
</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Frame Type</dt>
 <dd>
  The settings in a particular row apply to the frame type listed here: Unicast, Multicast or Broadcast.
 </dd>
 <dt>Enable</dt>
 <dd>
  Enable or disable the storm control status for the given frame type.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rate</dt>
 <dd>
  The rate unit is packets per second (pps). Valid values are:
  <samp>1</samp>, <samp>2</samp>, <samp>4</samp>, <samp>8</samp>, <samp>16</samp>, <samp>32</samp>, <samp>64</samp>,
  <samp>128</samp>, <samp>256</samp>, <samp>512</samp>, <samp>1K</samp>, <samp>2K</samp>, <samp>4K</samp>, <samp>8K</samp>,
