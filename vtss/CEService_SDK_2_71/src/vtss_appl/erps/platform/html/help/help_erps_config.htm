 <dt>Port 1 APS MEP</dt>
 <dd>
 See help on ERPS create WEB. </dd>
 <dt>Ring Type</dt>
 <dd>
 Type of Protecting ring. It can be either major ring or sub-ring.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Instance Configuration</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Configured</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>Red:</b> This ERPS is only created and has not yet been configured - is not active.</p>
 <p><b>Green:</b> This ERPS is configured - is active.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Guard Time</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Guard timeout value to be used to prevent ring nodes from receiving outdated R-APS messages.</p>
 <p>The period of the guard timer can be configured in 10 ms steps between 10 ms and 2 seconds, with a default value of 500 ms </p>
 </dd>

 <dt>WTR Time</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>The Wait To Restore timing value to be used in revertive switching.</p>
 <p>The period of the WTR time can be configured by the operator in 1 minute steps between 5 and 12 minutes with a default value of
   5 minutes.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Hold Off Time</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>The timing value to be used to make persistent check on Signal Fail before switching. </p>
 <p> The range of the hold off timer is 0 to 10 seconds in steps of 100 ms</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Version</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>ERPS Protocol Version - v1 or v2</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Revertive</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>In Revertive mode, after the conditions causing a protection switch has cleared, the traffic channel is
 restored to the working transport entity, i.e., blocked on the RPL.</p>
 <p>In Non-Revertive mode, the traffic channel continues to use the RPL, if it is not failed, after a protection 
 switch condition has cleared.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>VLAN config</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>VLAN configuration of the Protection Group. Click on the "VLAN Config" link to configure VLANs for this protection group.</p>
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>RPL Configuration </h2>
<dl>
 <dt>RPL Role</dt>
 <dd>
  <p>It can be either RPL owner or RPL Neighbor.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>RPL Port</dt>
 <dd>
  <p>This allows to select the east port or west port as the RPL block.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Clear</dt>
 <dd>
  <p>If the owner has to be changed, then the clear check box allows to clear the RPL owner for that ERPS ring.</p>
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Sub-Ring Configuration</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Topology Change</dt>
 <dd>
<p>Clicking this checkbox indicates that the topology changes in the sub-ring are propagated in the major ring.</p>
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Instance Command</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Command</dt>
  <dd>Administrative command. A port can be administratively configured to be in either manual switch or forced switch state.</dd>
  <dt>Forced Switch</dt>
  <dd>Forced Switch command forces a block on the ring port where the command is issued.</dd>
  <dt>Manual Switch</dt>
  <dd>In the absence of a failure or FS, Manual Switch command forces a block on the ring port where the command is issued.</dd>
  <dt>Clear</dt>
  <dd>The Clear command is used for clearing an active local administrative command (e.g., Forced Switch or Manual Switch).</dd>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>Port selection - Port0 or Port1 of the protection Group on which the command is applied.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Instance State</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Protection State</dt>
 <dd>
 ERPS state according to State Transition Tables in G.8032.
 </dd>
 <dt>Port 0</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>OK:</b> State of East port is ok</p>
 <p><b>SF:</b> State of East port is Signal Fail</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Port 1</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>OK:</b> State of West port is ok</p>
 <p><b>SF:</b> State of West port is Signal Fail</p> 
 </dd>
 <dt>Transmit APS</dt>
 <dd>
