 <dt>Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the UPnP operation mode. Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable UPnP mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable UPnP mode operation.
 <br>When the mode is enabled, two ACEs are added automatically to trap UPNP related packets to CPU. The ACEs are automatically removed when the mode is disabled.
 </dd>

 <dt>TTL</dt>
 <dd>
    The TTL value is used by UPnP to send SSDP advertisement messages. Valid values are in the range 1 to 255.
 </dd>
 
 <dt>Advertising Duration</dt>
 <dd>
    The duration, carried in SSDP packets, is used to inform a control point or control points how often it or they should receive an SSDP advertisement message from this switch. If a control point does not receive any message within the duration, it will think that the switch no longer exists. Due to the unreliable nature of <a href="glossary.htm#udp" class="glossary">UDP</a>, in the standard it is recommended that such refreshing of advertisements to be done at less than one-half of the advertising duration. In the implementation, the switch sends SSDP messages periodically at the interval one-half of the advertising duration minus 30 seconds.  Valid values are in the range 100 to 86400.
