<h1>Performance Monitor Delay Measurement Statistics Help</h1>
<p>This page provides the performance monitor delay measurement traffic statistics for the selected measurement interval ID and DElay Measurement instance.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Measurement Interval ID</dt>
 <dd>
 The measurement interval for the performance monitor data sets.
 </dd>

 <dt><a href="glossary.htm#MEP" class="glossary">MEP</a> Instance</dt>
 <dd>
 The MEP instance for the performance monitor data sets.
 </dd>

 <dt>Residence Port</dt>
 <dd>
 The residence port for the MEP.
 </dd>

 <dt>Priority</dt>
 <dd>
 The priority to be inserted as <a href="glossary.htm#PCP" class="glossary">PCP</a> bits in TAG (if any).
 </dd>

 <dt>Rate</dt>
 <dd>
 Selected the frame rate of CCM/LMM PDU. This is the inverse of transmission period as described in Y.1731.
 </dd>

 <dt>TX</dt>
 <dd>
 The number of transmitted.
 </dd>

 <dt>RX</dt>
 <dd>
 The number of received.
 </dd>

 <dt>Near End Loss Count</dt>
 <dd>
 The near end loss count.
 </dd>

 <dt>Near End Loss Ratio</dt>
 <dd>
 The near end loss ratio.
 </dd>

 <dt>Far End Loss Count</dt>
 <dd>
 The far end loss count.
 </dd>

 <dt>Far End Loss Ratio</dt>
 <dd>
 The far end loss ratio.
 </dd>

 <dt>Domain</dt>
 <dd>
 Port: This is a MEP in the Port Domain. 'Flow Instance' is a Port.
 <br>Evc: This is a MEP in the EVC Domain. 'Flow Instance' is a EVC.
 <br>VLAN: This is a MEP in the <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a> Domain. 'Flow Instance' is a VLAN. 
</dd>

 <dt>Direction</dt>
 <dd>
 Up: This is a Down MEP - monitoring ingress <a href="glossary.htm#OAM" class="glossary">OAM</a> and traffic on 'Residence Port'.
 <br>Down: This is a Up MEP - monitoring egress OAM and traffic on 'Residence Port'.
 </dd>

 <dt>Level</dt>
 <dd>
 The MEG level of this MEP.
 </dd>

 <dt>Flow Instance</dt>
 <dd>
 The MEP is related to this flow - See 'Domain'.
 </dd>

 <dt>Tagged VID</dt>
 <dd>
 Port MEP: An outer C/S-tag (depending on VLAN Port Type) is added with this VID. Entering '0' means no TAG added.
 <br>EVC MIP: On Serval, this is the Subscriber VID that identify the subscriber flow in this EVC where the MIP is active.
 </dd>

 <dt>MEP ID</dt>
 <dd>
 This value will become the transmitted two byte <a href="glossary.htm#CCM" class="glossary">CCM</a> MEP ID.
 </dd>

 <dt>MAC Address</dt>
 <dd>
 The MAC of this MEP - can be used by other MEP when unicast is selected (Info only).
 </dd>

 <dt>Peer MEP ID</dt>
 <dd>
 This value will become an expected MEP ID in a received CCM - see 'cMEP'.
 </dd>

 <dt>Peer MAC Address</dt>
 <dd>
 This MAC will be used when unicast is selected with this peer MEP. Also this MAC is used to create HW checking of receiving CCM PDU (<a href="glossary.htm#LOC" class="glossary">LOC</a> detection) from this MEP.
 </dd>
