<h1>EVC Configuration Help</h1>
<p>This page displays current <a href="glossary.htm#EVC" class="glossary">EVC</a> configurations. The settings can also be configured here.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>NNI Ports</dt>
 <dd>
 The list of Network to Network Interfaces for the EVC.
 </dd>

 <dt>EVC ID</dt>
 <dd>
 The EVC ID identifies the EVC.
 The allowed range is from <samp>1</samp> through <samp><span id="EvcIdMax">128</span></samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt>VID</dt>
 <dd>
 The <a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a> in the PB network.
 It may be inserted in a C-tag, S-tag or S-custom tag depending on the NNI port <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a> configuration.
 The allowed range is from <samp><span id="EvcVidMin">1</span></samp> through <samp>4095</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt>IVID</dt>
 <dd>
 The Internal/classified VLAN ID in the PB network.
 The allowed range is from <samp>1</samp> through <samp>4095</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Learning</dt>
 <dd>
 The learning mode for the EVC controls whether source MAC addresses are learned for frames matching the EVC. Learning may be disabled if the EVC only includes two UNI/NNI ports. The possible values are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Learning is enabled (MAC addresses are learned).
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Learning is disabled (MAC addresses are not learned).
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_arch_jaguar_1"><a href="glossary.htm#policer" class="glossary">Policer</a></dt>
 <dd class="has_arch_jaguar_1">
 The ingress bandwidth profile mode for the EVC. The possible values are:
 <br><samp>Specific</samp>: The allowed range is from <samp>1</samp> through <samp><span id="EvcPolicerIdMax">128</span></samp>.
 <br><samp>Discard</samp>: All received frames are discarded for the EVC.
 <br><samp>None</samp>: None bandwidth profile for the EVC.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_arch_serval">Policer</dt>
 <dd class="has_arch_serval">
 The ingress bandwidth profile mode for the EVC. The possible values are:
 <br><samp>Specific</samp>: The allowed range is from <samp>1</samp> through <samp><span id="EvcPolicerIdMax1">128</span></samp>.
 <br><samp>Discard</samp>: All received frames are discarded for the EVC.
 <br><samp>None</samp>: None bandwidth profile for the EVC.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_arch_luton26">Inner Tag Type</dt>
 <dd class="has_arch_luton26">
 The inner tag type is used to determine whether an inner tag is inserted in frames forwarded to NNI ports. The possible values are:
 <br><samp>None</samp>: An inner tag is not inserted.
 <br><samp>C-tag</samp>: An inner C-tag is inserted.
 <br><samp>S-tag</samp>: An inner S-tag is inserted.
 <br><samp>S-custom-tag</samp>: An inner tag is inserted and the tag type is determined by the VLAN port configuration of the NNI.
 </dd>
 <dt class="has_arch_luton26">Inner VID Mode</dt>
 <dd class="has_arch_luton26">
 The inner VID Mode affects the VID in the inner and outer tag. The possible values are:
 <br><samp>Normal</samp>: The VID of the two outer tags aren't swapped.
 <br><samp>Tunnel</samp>: The VID of the two outer tags are swapped, so that the VID of the outer tag is taken from the Inner Tag configuration and the VID of the inner tag is the EVC VID. In this mode, the NNI ports are normally configured to do EVC classification based on the inner tag.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_arch_luton26">Inner Tag VID</dt>
 <dd class="has_arch_luton26">
 The Inner tag VLAN ID.
 The allowed range is from <samp>0</samp> through <samp>4095</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_arch_luton26">Inner Tag <a href="glossary.htm#PCP" class="glossary">PCP</a>/<a href="glossary.htm#DEI" class="glossary">DEI</a> Preservation</dt>
 <dd class="has_arch_luton26">
 The inner tag PCP and DEI preservation. The possible values are:
 <br><samp>Preserved</samp>: The inner tag PCP and DEI is preserved.
 <br><samp>Fixed</samp>: The inner tag PCP and DEI is fixed.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_arch_luton26">Inner Tag PCP</dt>
 <dd class="has_arch_luton26">
 The inner tag PCP value.
 The allowed range is from <samp>0</samp> through <samp>7</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_arch_luton26">Inner Tag DEI</dt>
 <dd class="has_arch_luton26">
 The inner tag DEI value.
 The allowed value is <samp>0</samp> or <samp>1</samp>.
 </dd>
 
 <dt class="has_arch_luton26">Outer Tag VID</dt>
 <dd class="has_arch_luton26">
 The EVC outer tag VID for UNI ports.
 The allowed range is from <samp>0</samp> through <samp>4095</samp>.
 </dd>
