<h1>MAC Address Table Configuration Help</h1>


<p>The MAC Address Table is configured on this page. Set timeouts for entries in the dynamic <a href="glossary.htm#MAC_table" class="glossary">MAC Table</a> and configure the static MAC table here.</p>

 <h2>Aging Configuration</h2>
<p>
By default, dynamic entries are removed from the MAC table after 300 seconds. This removal is also called aging.
<br><br>
Configure aging time by entering a value here in seconds; for example, <b>Age time</b><INPUT size = "6">seconds.
<br> 
The allowed range is <samp>10</samp> to <samp>1000000</samp> seconds.
<br><br>Disable the automatic aging of dynamic entries by checking <input type="checkbox" name="DisableAgeing">
<b>Disable automatic aging</b>.</p>

<h2><a href="glossary.htm#MAC_table" class="glossary">MAC Table</a> Learning</h2>
  If the learning mode for a given port is greyed out, another module is in
  control of the mode, so that it cannot be changed by the user. An example
  of such a module is the MAC-Based Authentication under 802.1X.<br/>
  Each port can do learning based upon the following settings:
<dl>
<dt>Auto</dt>
<dd>Learning is done automatically as soon as a frame with unknown SMAC is received. </dd>
<dt>Disable</dt>
<dd>No learning is done.</dd>
<dt>Secure</dt>
<dd>Only static MAC entries are learned, all other frames are dropped.<br><b>Note:</b> Make sure that the link used for managing the switch is added to the 
          Static Mac Table before changing to secure learning mode, otherwise the management link is lost and can only be restored by using another non-secure 
	  port or by connecting to the switch via the serial interface.</dd>

 <h2>Static MAC Table Configuration</h2>

<p>The static entries in the MAC table are shown in this table. The static MAC table can contain 64 entries. </p>
<span class="SPOM_only">The maximum of 64 entries is for the whole stack, and not per switch.</span>

<p>The MAC table is sorted first by <a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a> and then by MAC address.</p>

<dl>
      <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd>
Check to delete the entry. It will be deleted during the next save.
 </dd>
 
 <dt><a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a> ID</dt>
 <dd>
The VLAN ID of the entry.
 </dd>
<dt>MAC Address</dt>
 <dd>
The MAC address of the entry.
 </dd>
 <dt>Port Members</dt>
 <dd>
Checkmarks indicate which ports are members of the entry. Check or uncheck as needed to modify the entry.
 </dd>

<dt>Adding a New Static Entry</dt>
<dd>Click <input TYPE=button value="Add New Static Entry"> to add a new entry to the static MAC table. Specify the VLAN ID, MAC address, and port members for the new entry. Click "Save". </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><input type="button" value=" Save ">: Click to save changes.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Reset ">: Click to undo any changes made locally and revert to previously saved values.</p>
