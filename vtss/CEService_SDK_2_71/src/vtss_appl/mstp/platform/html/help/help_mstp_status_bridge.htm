<h1>STP Detailed Bridge Status Help</h1>

<p>This page provides detailed information on a single <a href="glossary.htm#rstp" class="glossary">STP</a> bridge
instance, along with port state for all active ports associated.</p>

<p>The page contains two tables with the following information:</p>

<h2>STP Bridge Status</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>Bridge Instance</dt>
 <dd>
 The Bridge instance - <samp>CIST</samp>, <samp>MST1</samp>, ...
 </dd>

 <dt>Bridge ID</dt>
 <dd>
 The Bridge ID of this Bridge instance.
 </dd>

 <dt>Root ID</dt>
 <dd>
 The Bridge ID of the currently elected root bridge.
 </dd>

 <dt>Root Port</dt>
 <dd>
 The switch port currently assigned the <i>root</i> port role.
 </dd>

 <dt>Root Cost</dt>
 <dd>
 Root Path Cost. For the Root Bridge this is zero. For all other
 Bridges, it is the sum of the Port Path Costs on the least cost path
 to the Root Bridge.
 </dd>

 <dt>Regional Root</dt>
 <dd>
 The Bridge ID of the currently elected regional root bridge, inside
 the 
 <a href="glossary.htm#mstp" class="glossary">MSTP</a>
 region of this bridge. <em>(For the CIST instance
 only)</em>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Internal Root Cost</dt>
 <dd>
 The Regional Root Path Cost. For the Regional Root Bridge this is
 zero. For all other CIST instances in the same MSTP region, it is the
 sum of the Internal Port Path Costs on the least cost path to the
 Internal Root Bridge. <em>(For the CIST instance only)</em>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Topology Flag</dt>
 <dd>
 The current state of the Topology Change Flag of this Bridge
 instance.
 </dd>

 <dt>Topology Change Count</dt>
 <dd>
 The number of times where the topology change flag has been set
 (during a one-second interval).
 </dd>

 <dt>Topology Change Last</dt>
 <dd>
 The time passed since the Topology Flag was last set.
 </dd>

</dl>

<h2>CIST Ports<span class="haveAggregations"> &amp; Aggregations</span> State</h2>
<dl>

 <dt class="SPOM_only"><a href="glossary.htm#switch_id" class="glossary">Switch ID</a></dt>
 <dd class="SPOM_only">
 The Switch ID of the logical port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   The switch port number of the logical STP port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port ID</dt>
 <dd>
   The port id as used by the STP protocol. This is the priority part
   and the logical port index of the bridge port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Role</dt>
 <dd>
 The current STP port role. The port role can be one of the following
 values: 
 <samp>AlternatePort</samp> <samp>BackupPort</samp> 
 <samp>RootPort</samp> <samp>DesignatedPort</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt>State</dt>
 <dd>
 The current STP port state. The port state can be one of the following
 values:
 <samp>Discarding</samp> <samp>Learning</samp> <samp>Forwarding</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Path Cost</dt>
 <dd>
 The current STP port path cost. This will either be a value computed
 from the <samp>Auto</samp> setting, or any explicitly configured
 value.
 </dd>

 <dt>Edge</dt>
 <dd>
 The current STP port (operational) Edge Flag. An Edge Port is a
 switch port to which no Bridges are attached. The flag may be
 automatically computed or explicitly configured. Each Edge Port
 transits directly to the Forwarding Port State, since there is no
 possibility of it participating in a loop.
 </dd>

 <dt>Point-to-Point</dt>
 <dd>
 The current STP port point-to-point flag. A point-to-point port
 connects to a non-shared LAN media. The flag may be automatically
 computed or explicitly configured. The point-to-point properties of a
 port affect how fast it can transit to STP state.
 </dd>

 <dt>Uptime</dt>
 <dd>
   The time since the bridge port was last initialized.
 </dd>

</dl>
