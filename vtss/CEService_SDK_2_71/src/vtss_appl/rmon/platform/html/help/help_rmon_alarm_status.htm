<h1>RMON Alarm Overview Help</h1>

<p>
  This page provides an overview of RMON Alarm entries. Each page shows up to 99 entries from the
  Alarm table, default being 20, selected through the
  "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries from
  the beginning of the Alarm table. The first displayed will be the one with the lowest ID
  found in the Alarm table.<br/>
  The "Start from Control Index" allows the user to select the
  starting point in the Alarm table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the next closest Alarm table match.<br/>
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed entry
  as a basis for the next lookup. When the end is reached the text "No more entries" is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.
