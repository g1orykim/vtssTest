<p>This page provides a status overview of all <a href="glossary.htm#lldpmed" class="glossary">LLDP-MED</a> neighbors.
   The displayed table contains a row for each port on which an LLDP neighbor is detected. This function applies to VoIP devices which support LLDP-MED. The columns hold the following information:
</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   The port on which the LLDP frame was received.

 <p>LLDP-MED Devices are comprised of two primary <b>Device Types</b>: Network Connectivity Devices and
Endpoint Devices. </p>
<b>LLDP-MED Network Connectivity Device Definition</b>
<p>LLDP-MED Network Connectivity Devices, as defined in TIA-1057, provide access to the IEEE
802 based LAN infrastructure for LLDP-MED Endpoint Devices. An LLDP-MED Network Connectivity
Device is a LAN access device based on any of the following technologies:</p>
<p>1. LAN Switch/Router</p>
<p>2. IEEE 802.1 Bridge</p>
<p>3. IEEE 802.3 Repeater (included for historical reasons)</p>
<p>4. IEEE 802.11 Wireless Access Point</p>
<p>5. Any device that supports the IEEE 802.1AB and MED extensions defined by TIA-1057
and can relay IEEE 802 frames via any method.</p>


<b>LLDP-MED Endpoint Device Definition</b>
<p> LLDP-MED Endpoint Devices, as defined in TIA-1057, are located at the IEEE 802 LAN network
edge, and participate in IP communication service using the LLDP-MED framework.</p>
<p>Within the LLDP-MED Endpoint Device category, the LLDP-MED scheme is broken into further
Endpoint Device Classes, as defined in the following.</p>
<p>Each LLDP-MED Endpoint Device Class is defined to build upon the capabilities
defined for the previous Endpoint Device Class. For-example will any LLDP-MED Endpoint
Device claiming compliance as a Media Endpoint (Class II) also
support all aspects of TIA-1057 applicable to Generic Endpoints (Class I), and any LLDP-MED Endpoint
Device claiming compliance as a Communication Device (Class III) will also support all aspects of
TIA-1057 applicable to both Media Endpoints (Class II) and Generic Endpoints (Class I).</p>
<b>LLDP-MED Generic Endpoint (Class I)</b>
<p>The LLDP-MED Generic Endpoint (Class I) definition is applicable to all endpoint products that require
the base LLDP discovery services defined in TIA-1057, however do not support IP media or act
as an end-user communication appliance. Such devices may include (but are not limited to) IP
Communication Controllers, other communication related servers, or any device requiring basic
services as defined in TIA-1057.</p>
<p>Discovery services defined in this class include LAN configuration, device location, network policy,
power management, and inventory management.</p>
<b>LLDP-MED Media Endpoint (Class II)</b>
<p>The LLDP-MED Media Endpoint (Class II) definition is applicable to all endpoint products that have IP
media capabilities however may or may not be associated with a particular end user. Capabilities
include all of the capabilities defined for the previous Generic Endpoint Class (Class I), and are
extended to include aspects related to media streaming. Example product categories expected to
adhere to this class include (but are not limited to) Voice / Media Gateways, Conference Bridges,
Media Servers, and similar.</p>
<p>Discovery services defined in this class include media-type-specific network layer policy discovery.</p>
<b>LLDP-MED Communication Endpoint (Class III)</b>
<p>The LLDP-MED Communication Endpoint (Class III) definition is applicable to all endpoint products
that act as end user communication appliances supporting IP media. Capabilities include all of the
capabilities defined for the previous Generic Endpoint (Class I) and Media Endpoint (Class II) classes,
and are extended to include aspects related to end user devices. Example product categories
expected to adhere to this class include (but are not limited to) end user communication appliances,
such as IP Phones, PC-based softphones, or other communication appliances that directly support
the end user.</p>
<p>Discovery services defined in this class include provision of location identifier (including ECS / E911
information), embedded L2 switch support, inventory management.</p>
  </dd>
 <dt>LLDP-MED Capabilities</dt>
 <dd>
   <p><b>LLDP-MED Capabilities</b> describes the neighbor unit's
   LLDP-MED capabilities. The possible capabilities are:</p>
   <p>1. LLDP-MED capabilities</p>
   <p>2. Network Policy</p>
   <p>3. Location Identification</p>
   <p>4. Extended Power via MDI - PSE</p>
   <p>5. Extended Power via MDI - PD</p>
   <p>6. Inventory</p>
   <p>7. Reserved</p>
 </dd>

 <dt>Application Type</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>Application Type</b> indicating the primary function of the application(s) defined for
this network policy, advertised by an Endpoint or Network Connectivity
   Device. The possible application types are shown below.</p>
 <p>1. Voice - for use by dedicated IP Telephony handsets and other similar appliances supporting
interactive voice services. These devices are typically deployed on a separate VLAN for ease
of deployment and enhanced security by isolation from data
   applications.</p>
 <p>2. Voice Signalling - for use in network topologies that require a different policy for
the voice signalling than for the voice media.</p>
 <p>3. Guest Voice - to support a separate limited feature-set voice service for guest users and
visitors with their own IP Telephony handsets and other similar appliances supporting
interactive voice services.</p>
 <p>4. Guest Voice Signalling - for use in network topologies that require a different
policy for the guest voice signalling than for the guest voice media.</p>
 <p>5. Softphone Voice - for use by softphone applications on typical data centric devices, such as
PCs or laptops.</p>
 <p>6. Video Conferencing - for use by dedicated Video Conferencing equipment and other similar
appliances supporting real-time interactive video/audio services.</p>
 <p>7. Streaming Video - for use by broadcast or multicast based video content distribution and other
similar applications supporting streaming video services that require specific network policy
treatment. Video applications relying on TCP with buffering would not be an intended use of
this application type.</p>
 <p>8. Video Signalling - for use in network topologies that require a separate policy for
the video signalling than for the video media.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Policy</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>Policy</b> indicates that an Endpoint Device wants to explicitly advertise that
 the policy is required by the device. Can be either Defined or Unknown </p>
 <p>Unknown: The network policy for the specified application type is
 currently unknown.</p>
 <p>Defined: The network policy is defined.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>TAG</dt>
 <dd>
 <p><b>TAG</b> is indicative of whether the specified application type is using a tagged
 or an untagged VLAN. Can be Tagged or Untagged.</p>
 <p>Untagged: The device is using an untagged frame format and as such does not include
a tag header as defined by IEEE 802.1Q-2003.</p> 
 <p>Tagged: The device is using the IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame format.</p>

 </dd>
 <dt>VLAN ID</dt>
 <dd>
  <p><b>VLAN ID</b> is the VLAN identifier (VID) for the port as defined
    in IEEE 802.1Q-2003. A value of 1 through 4094 is used to define a valid VLAN ID.
    A value of 0 (Priority Tagged) is used if the device is using priority tagged frames as defined by
    IEEE 802.1Q-2003, meaning that only the IEEE 802.1D priority level is significant and the default
    PVID of the ingress port is used instead.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Priority</dt>
 <dd>
  <p><b>Priority</b> is the Layer 2 priority to be used for the specified application type. One of the eight priority levels (0 through 7).</p>
 </dd>

 <dt>DSCP</dt>
 <dd>
  <p><b>DSCP</b> is the DSCP value to be used to provide Diffserv node behavior for the specified
    application type as defined in IETF RFC 2474. Contain one of 64 code point
    values (0 through 63).</p>
 </dd>
 


<dt>Auto-negotiation</dt>
 <dd>
<p><b>Auto-negotiation</b> identifies if MAC/PHY auto-negotiation is supported by
the link partner.</p>
 </dd>

<dt>Auto-negotiation status</dt>
 <dd>
<p><b>Auto-negotiation status</b> identifies if auto-negotiation is
currently enabled at the link partner. If <b>Auto-negotiation</b> is
supported and <b>Auto-negotiation status</b> is disabled, the 802.3 PMD operating mode will be
determined the operational MAU type field value rather than by auto-negotiation.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Auto-negotiation Capabilities</dt>
 <dd>
<p><b>Auto-negotiation Capabilities</b> shows the link partners MAC/PHY
capabilities.</p>
