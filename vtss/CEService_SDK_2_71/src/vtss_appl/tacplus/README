                      LibTACPLUS

(old name - libtacacs)

--------------------------------------------------------------
This is a C frontend to Cisco's TACACS+ protocol.

This library was a first step in project of TACACS+ server
from our company.
(the tacpp project was separated from it and now developing with
own C++ implementation of tacacs+ protocol, see
http://tacppd.org for more information)

I hope, that this library will be useful for developers.

You can use, modificate and redistribute this library
without any limitations.
