<h1>IGMP Snooping VLAN Configuration Help</h1>



<h2> Navigating the <a href="glossary.htm#igmp" class="glossary">IGMP</a> Snooping <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a> Table</h2>
<p>
  Each page shows up to 99 entries from the VLAN table, default being 20, selected through the
  "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries from
  the beginning of the VLAN Table. The first displayed will be the one with the lowest <a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a>
  found in the VLAN Table.<br/>
  The "VLAN" input fields allow the user to select the starting point in the VLAN Table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the next closest VLAN Table match.<br/>
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed entry
  as a basis for the next lookup. When the end is reached the text "No more entries" is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.

<h2>IGMP Snooping VLAN Table Columns</h2>
<dl>

 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd>
 Check to delete the entry. The designated entry will be deleted during the next save.
 </dd>

 <dt>VLAN ID</dt>
 <dd>
 The VLAN ID of the entry.
 </dd>

 <dt>IGMP Snooping Enabled</dt>
 <dd>
 Enable the per-VLAN IGMP Snooping. Up to 32 VLANs can be selected for IGMP Snooping.
 </dd>

 <dt><a href="glossary.htm#querier_election" class="glossary">Querier Election</a></dt>
 <dd>
 Enable to join IGMP Querier election in the VLAN.  Disable to act as an IGMP Non-Querier.
 </dd>

 <dt>Querier Address</dt>
 <dd>
 Define the IPv4 address as source address used in IP header for IGMP <a href="glossary.htm#querier_election" class="glossary">Querier election</a>.<br/>
 When the Querier address is not set, system uses IPv4 management address of the IP interface associated with this VLAN.<br/>
 When the IPv4 management address is not set, system uses the first available IPv4 management address.<br/>
 Otherwise, system uses a pre-defined value.  By default, this value will be 192.0.2.1.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">Compatibility</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Compatibility is maintained by hosts and routers taking appropriate actions
 depending on the versions of IGMP operating on hosts and routers within a network.<br/>
 The allowed selection is <samp>IGMP-Auto</samp>, <samp>Forced IGMPv1</samp>,
 <samp>Forced IGMPv2</samp>, <samp>Forced IGMPv3</samp>, default compatibility value is IGMP-Auto.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">PRI</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Priority of Interface.<br/>
 It indicates the IGMP control frame priority level generated by the system.
 These values can be used to prioritize different classes of traffic.<br/>
 The allowed range is <samp>0</samp> (best effort) to <samp>7</samp> (highest), default interface priority value is 0.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">RV</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Robustness Variable.<br/>
 The Robustness Variable allows tuning for the expected packet loss on a network.<br/>
 The allowed range is <samp>1</samp> to <samp>255</samp>, default robustness variable value is 2.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">QI</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Query Interval.<br/>
 The Query Interval is the interval between General Queries sent by the Querier.<br/>

 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">QRI</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Query Response Interval.<br/>
 The Maximum Response Delay used to calculate the Maximum Response Code inserted into the periodic General Queries.<br/>
 The allowed range is <samp>0</samp> to <samp>31744</samp> in tenths of seconds, default query response interval is 100 in tenths of seconds (10 seconds).

 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Last Member Query Interval.<br/>
 The Last Member Query Time is the time value represented by the Last
 Member Query Interval, multiplied by the Last Member Query Count.<br/>
 The allowed range is <samp>0</samp> to <samp>31744</samp> in tenths of seconds, default last member query interval is 10 in tenths of seconds (1 second).
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">URI</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Unsolicited Report Interval.
 The Unsolicited Report Interval is the time between repetitions of a
 host's initial report of membership in a group.<br/>
 The allowed range is <samp>0</samp> to <samp>31744</samp> seconds, default unsolicited report interval is 1 second.

<h2>Buttons</h2>

<p><input type="button" value="Refresh">: Refreshes the displayed table starting from the "VLAN" input fields.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" |<< ">: Updates the table starting from the first entry in the VLAN Table, i.e. the entry with the lowest VLAN ID.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" >> ">: Updates the table, starting with the entry after the last entry currently displayed.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Add New IGMP VLAN ">: Click to add new IGMP VLAN.  Specify the VID and configure the new entry. Click "Save".
