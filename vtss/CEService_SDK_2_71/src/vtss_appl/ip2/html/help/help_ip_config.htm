settings, control IP interfaces and IP routes.

     Configure whether the IP stack should act as a <samp>Host</samp>

 <legend>IP Interfaces</legend>
 <dl>

   <dt>Delete</dt>
   <dd>
     Select this option to delete an existing IP interface.
   </dd>

   <dt>VLAN</dt>
   <dd>
     The VLAN associated with the IP interface. Only ports in this
     VLAN will be able to access the IP interface. This field is only
     available for input when creating an new interface.
   </dd>

   <dt>IPv4 <a href="glossary.htm#dhcp" class="glossary">DHCP</a> Enabled</dt>
   <dd>
     Enable the DHCP client by checking this box. If this option is
     enabled, the system will configure the IPv4 address and mask of the
     interface using the DHCP protocol. The DHCP client will announce
     the configured System Name as hostname to provide DNS lookup.
   </dd>

   <dt>IPv4 DHCP Fallback Timeout</dt>
   <dd>
     The number of seconds for trying to obtain a DHCP lease. After
     this period expires, a configured IPv4 address will be used as
     IPv4 interface address. A value of zero disables the fallback
     mechanism, such that DHCP will keep retrying until a valid lease
     is obtained. Legal values are 0 to 4294967295 seconds.
   </dd>

   <dt>IPv4 DHCP Current Lease</dt>
   <dd>
     For DHCP interfaces with an active lease, this column show the
     current interface address, as provided by the DHCP server.
   </dd>

   <dt>IPv4 Address</dt>
   <dd>
     The IPv4 address of the interface
     in <a href="glossary.htm#dotted_decimal" class="glossary">dotted
     decimal notation</a>. <br> If <samp>DHCP</samp> is enabled, this
     field configures the fallback address. The field may be left
     blank if IPv4 operation on the interface is not desired - or no
     DHCP fallback address is desired.
   </dd>

   <dt>IPv4 Mask</dt>
   <dd>
     The IPv4 network mask, in number of bits (<i>prefix
     length</i>). Valid values are between 0 and 30 bits for a IPv4
     address. <br> If <samp>DHCP</samp> is enabled, this field
     configures the fallback address network mask. The field may be
     left blank if IPv4 operation on the interface is not desired - or
     no DHCP fallback address is desired.
   </dd>

   <dt class="ipv6 hidden">IPv6 Address</dt>
   <dd class="ipv6 hidden">
     The IPv6 address of the interface. A IPv6 address is in 128-bit
     records represented as eight fields of up to four hexadecimal
     digits with a colon separating each field (:).  For example,
     <samp>fe80::215:c5ff:fe03:4dc7</samp>.  The
     symbol <samp>::</samp> is a special syntax that can be used as a
     shorthand way of representing multiple 16-bit groups of
     contiguous zeros; but it can appear only once.  It can also
     represent a legally valid IPv4 address. For example,
     <samp>::192.1.2.34</samp>.
     <br>The field may be left blank if IPv6 operation on the
     interface is not desired.
   </dd>

   <dt class="ipv6 hidden">IPv6 Mask</dt>
   <dd class="ipv6 hidden">
     The IPv6 network mask, in number of bits (<i>prefix
     length</i>). Valid values are between 1 and 128 bits for a IPv6
     address.
     <br>The field may be left blank if IPv6 operation on the

   <dt>Delete</dt>
   <dd>
     Select this option to delete an existing IP route.
   </dd>

   <dt>Network</dt>
   <dd>
     The destination IP network or host address of this route. Valid format is 
     <a href="glossary.htm#dotted_decimal" class="glossary">dotted
     decimal notation</a><span class="ipv6 hidden">or a valid IPv6
     notation</span>. A default route can use the

     IPv6 <samp>::</samp> notation</span>.
   </dd>

   <dt>Mask Length</dt>
   <dd>
     The destination IP network or host mask, in number of bits
     (<i>prefix length</i>). It defines how much of a network address
     that must match, in order to qualify for this route. Valid values
     are between 0 and 32 bits <span class="ipv6 hidden"> respectively
     128 for IPv6 routes</span>. Only a default route will have a mask
     length of <samp>0</samp> (as it will match anything).
   </dd>

   <dt>Gateway</dt>
   <dd>
     The IP address of the IP gateway. Valid format is 
     <a href="glossary.htm#dotted_decimal" class="glossary">dotted
     decimal notation</a><span class="ipv6 hidden">or a valid IPv6
     notation. Gateway and Network must be of the same type</span>.
   </dd>

   <dt>Next Hop VLAN (Only for IPv6)</dt>
   <dd>
     The VLAN ID (VID) of the specific IPv6 interface associated with the gateway.<br/>
     The given VID ranges from 1 to 4094 and will be effective only when the corresponding IPv6 interface is valid.<br/>
     If the IPv6 gateway address is link-local, it must specify the next hop VLAN for the gateway.<br/>
     If the IPv6 gateway address is not link-local, system ignores the next hop VLAN for the gateway.<br/>
