<h1>Port to Group mapping Table Help</h1>

<p>This page allows you to map set of Port members to a Group ID for all switch ports.</p>
<p class="SPOM_only">The settings relate to the currently selected stack
unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<p>The displayed settings are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt >Group ID</dt>
 <dd>A valid Group ID is an integer value form 1 to <script type="text/javascript"> document.write(configNormalPortMax);</script>.
    A set of VLAN Translations are mapped to a group Id. This way a port is mapped to
    a list of VLAN Translations easily by mapping it to a group. Number of groups in this 
    switch is equal to the number of ports (<script type="text/javascript"> document.write(configNormalPortMax);</script>)
    present in this switch. A port can be mapped 
    to any of the groups. Multiple ports can also be mapped to a group with same group Id.<br />
    <b>Note:</b>
	By default,
	each port is mapped to a group with a group Id equal to the port number. For
	example, port 1 is mapped to the group with ID=1.
    
  </dd>
<dt>Port Members</dt>
<dd>
A row of radio buttons, one radio button for each port is displayed for each Group ID. To include a port in a Group, click the radio button. A port must belong to at least one group.
 </dd>
 <dt>Adding a New Port to Group mapping entry</dt>
 <dd>
   Click <input type="button" value=" Add New Entry "> to add a new entry in Port to Group Mapping Table. An empty row is added
   to the table with the Group ID and array of radio buttons, one radio button for each port(click corresponding radio button to make port to be member of a particular Group). Note that if a VLAN translation is enabled on a management port for management VLAN, it may disrupt the management connectivity in some cases.
   <p>Legal values for a VLAN ID are
   <samp>1</samp> through <samp>4095</samp>.</p>
   The <input type="button" value=" Delete "> button can be used to undo the addition of new entry.
 </dd>
