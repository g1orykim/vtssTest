<h1>LEDs Power Reduction Help</h1>
<h2>LEDs switch on Help</h2>

<h2>LEDs</h2>
<h3>Status LED</h3>
<p>The system status LED shows whether the system is
running. The LED is green when system is running and no errors are
detected. If errors has been detected the status LED will indicate this
by blinking red</p>

<h3>Front Ethernet Port LEDs</h3>
<p>The front Ethernet ports have a dual color LEDs per port. The port
LEDs is placed in a block (1-high for SFPs, 2-high for RJ45s) to the left of the ports.</p>
<p>A pushbutton and a 4-high tower of LEDs is placed next to the
front ethernet port LEDs. The pushbutton selects between four different
port LED modes, indicated by the 4-high LED mode tower. After 30 seconds
the LED mode falls back to mode A.</p>

<p>The port LED modes are named A through D and shows the following</p>
<h4>Port LED Indication mode D:</h4>
<p>Green (1000Mbit): Solid=Link, Blink=Activity</p>
<p>Orange (10/100Mbit): Solid=Link, Blink=Activity</p>

<h4>Port LED Indication mode C:</h4>
<p>Green: Solid=Full Duplex Off=No link</p>
<p>Orange: Solid=Half Duplex, Blink: Collisions</p>

<h4>Port LED Indication mode B:</h4>
<p>Green: Solid = Link, Blink=Activity</p>
<p>Orange: Solid = Port disabled by management, Blink = Errors received</p>

<h4>Port LED Indication mode A:</h4>
<p>Power save mode - LEDs are off.</p>



<h2>LEDs Intensity</h2>
<dl>
 <dd>
 The LEDs power consumption can be reduced by lowering the LEDs
 intensity. 
LEDs intensity could for example be lowered during night time, or they could be turn completely off.
It is possible to configure 24 different hours of the day, at where the LEDs 
intensity should be set. 
 </dd>

 <dt>Start Time</dt>
 <dd>
   The time at which the LEDs intensity shall be set to the corresponding intensity. 
 </dd>

 <dt>End Time</dt>
 <dd>
   The time at which the LEDs intensity shall be set to a new intensity. If no intensity is specified for the next hour, the intensity is set to default intensity. 
 </dd>

 <dt>Intensity</dt>
 <dd>
   The LEDs intensity (100% = Full power, 0% = LED off). 
 </dd>
</dl>



<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<dl>
<dt> Maintenance Time</dt>
<dd>
When a network administrator does maintenance of the switch (e.g. adding or 
moving users) he might want to have full LED intensity during the
maintenance period . Therefore it is possible to specify that the LEDs shall use full
intensity a specific period of time. <b>Maintenance Time</b> is the number of seconds
that the LEDs will have full intensity after either a port has changed
link state, or the LED pushbutton has been pushed.
</dd>
