<h1>ERPS Help</h1>

<p>The Ethernet Ring Protection Switch instances are configured here.</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd>
 This box is used to mark an ERPS for deletion in next Save operation.
 </dd>
 <dt>Protection group ID</dt>
 <dd>
 The ID of the created Protection group. Click on the ID of an Protection group to enter the configuration page.
 </dd>
 <dt>Port 0</dt>
 <dd>
 <p> This will create a Port 0 of the switch in the ring.</p> 
 </dd>
 <dt>Port 1</dt>
 <dd>
 <p> This will create "Port 1" of the switch in the Ring. As interconnected sub-ring will have only one ring port, "Port 1" is configured as "0" for interconnected sub-ring. "0" in this field indicates that no "Port 1" is associated with this instance</p> 
 </dd>
 <dt>Port 0 SF MEP</dt>
 <dd>
 The Port 0 Signal Fail reporting MEP.
 </dd>
 <dt>Port 1 SF MEP</dt>
 <dd>
 The Port 1 Signal Fail reporting MEP. As only one SF MEP is associated with interconnected sub-ring without virtual channel, it is configured as "0" for such ring instances. "0" in this field indicates that no Port 1 SF MEP is associated with this instance.
 </dd>
 <dt>Port 0 APS MEP</dt>
 <dd> 
 The Port 0 APS PDU handling MEP.
 </dd>
 <dt>Port 1 APS MEP</dt>
 <dd>
 The Port 1 APS PDU handling MEP. As only one APS MEP is associated with interconnected sub-ring without virtual channel, it is configured as "0" for such ring instances. "0" in this field indicates that no Port 1 APS MEP is associated with this instance.
 </dd>
 <dt>Ring Type</dt>
 <dd>
 Type of Protecting ring. It can be either major ring or sub-ring.
 </dd>
 <dt>Interconnected Node</dt>
 <dd>
 Interconnected Node indicates that the ring instance is interconnected. Click on the checkbox to configure this. "Yes" indicates it is an interconnected node for this instance. "No" indicates that the configured instance is not interconnected.
 </dd>
 <dt>Virtual Channel</dt>
 <dd>
 Sub-rings can either have virtual channel or not on the interconnected node. This is configured using "Virtual Channel" checkbox. "Yes" indicates it is a sub-ring with virtual channel. "No" indicates, sub-ring doesn't have virtual channel.
 </dd>
 <dt>Major Ring ID</dt>
 <dd>
 Major ring group ID for the interconnected sub-ring. It is used to send topology change updates on major ring. If ring is major, this value is same as the protection group ID of this ring.
 </dd>
  <dt>Alarm</dt>
 <dd>
 There is an active alarm on the ERPS.
 </dd>
