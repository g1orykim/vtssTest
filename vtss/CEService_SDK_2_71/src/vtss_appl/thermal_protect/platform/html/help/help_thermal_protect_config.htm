<h1>Thermal Protection Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect and configure the current
  setting for controlling thermal protection. Thermal protection is
  used to protect the chip from getting overheated. </p>
<p>When the temperature exceeds the configured thermal protection temperature,
  ports will be turned off in order to decrease the power consumption. It
  is possible to arrange the ports with different priorities. Each
  priority can be given a temperature at which the corresponding ports
  shall be turned off.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Temperature settings for priority groups</dt>
 <dd>
  The temperature at which the ports with the corresponding priority
 will be turned off. Temperatures between 0 and 255 C are supported.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port priorities</dt>
 <dd>
   The priority the port belongs to. 4 priorities are supported.
