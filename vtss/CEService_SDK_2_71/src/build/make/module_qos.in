# will change the application in the following way:
#  1:  The number of port policers will be reduced from 4 to 1.
#  2:  The port policer configuration will be the same as on Luton26.
#  3:  Two of the now unused port policers will be used as storm policers.
#  4:  CLI and Web enables configuration of these two storm policers.
