 <h2>Fast start repeat count</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Fast start repeat count</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Rapid startup and Emergency Call Service Location Identification Discovery of endpoints is a critically
 important aspect of VoIP systems in general. In addition, it is best to advertise only those pieces of
information which are specifically relevant to particular endpoint types (for example only advertise the
voice network policy to permitted voice-capable devices), both in order to conserve the limited LLDPU
space and to reduce security and system integrity issues that can come with inappropriate knowledge
of the network policy.</p>

<p>With this in mind LLDP-MED defines an LLDP-MED Fast Start interaction
between the protocol and the application layers on top of the protocol,
in order to achieve these related properties. Initially, a Network
Connectivity Device will only transmit LLDP TLVs in an LLDPDU. Only
after an LLDP-MED Endpoint Device is detected, will an LLDP-MED capable
Network Connectivity Device start to advertise LLDP-MED TLVs in outgoing
LLDPDUs on the associated port. The LLDP-MED application will
temporarily speed up the transmission of the LLDPDU to start within a
second, when a new LLDP-MED neighbor has been detected in order share
LLDP-MED information as fast as possible to new neighbors.</p>

<p>Because there is a risk of an LLDP frame being lost during
transmission between neighbors, it is recommended  to repeat the fast
start transmission multiple times to increase the possibility of
the neighbors receiving the LLDP frame. With <b>Fast start repeat count</b>
it is possible to specify the number of times the fast start
transmission would be repeated. The recommended value is 4 times, given that
4 LLDP frames with a 1 second interval will be transmitted, when an LLDP
frame with new information is received. </p>

<p>It should be noted that LLDP-MED and the LLDP-MED Fast Start mechanism is only intended to run on links between LLDP-MED Network Connectivity Devices and Endpoint Devices, and as such does not apply to links between LAN infrastructure elements, including Network Connectivity Devices, or other types of links.</p>

 <h2>Coordinates Location</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Latitude</dt>
<dd>
<p><b>Latitude</b> SHOULD be normalized to within 0-90 degrees with a
maximum of 4 digits.</p>
<p>It is possible to specify the direction to either <b>North</b> of the equator or <b>South</b> of the equator.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Longitude</dt>
<dd>
<p><b>Longitude</b> SHOULD be normalized to within 0-180 degrees with a
maximum of 4 digits.</p>
<p>It is possible to specify the direction to either <b>East</b> of the prime meridian or <b>West</b> of the prime meridian.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Altitude</dt>
<dd>
<p><b>Altitude</b> SHOULD be normalized to within -32767 to 32767 with
a maximum of 4 digits.</p>
<p>It is possible to select between two altitude types (floors or
meters).</p>
<p><b>Meters</b>: Representing meters of Altitude defined by the vertical datum specified.</p>
<p><b>Floors</b>: Representing altitude in a form more relevant in buildings which have different floor-to-floor dimensions. An altitude = 0.0 is meaningful even outside a building, and represents ground level at the given latitude and longitude.  Inside a building, 0.0 represents   the floor level associated with ground level at the main entrance.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Map Datum</dt>

4327, Prime Meridian Name: Greenwich.</p>
<p><b>NAD83/NAVD88</b>: North American Datum 1983, CRS Code 4269, Prime
Meridian Name: Greenwich; The associated vertical datum is the North
American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). This datum pair is to be used
when referencing locations on land, not near tidal water (which would use Datum = NAD83/MLLW).</p>
<p><b>NAD83/MLLW</b>:  North American Datum 1983, CRS Code 4269, Prime Meridian

<h2>Policies</h2>
<dl>
 <dd>
<p>Network Policy Discovery enables the efficient discovery and diagnosis of mismatch issues with the
VLAN configuration, along with the associated Layer 2 and Layer 3 attributes, which apply for a set of
specific protocol applications on that port. Improper network policy configurations are a very
significant issue in VoIP environments that frequently result in voice quality degradation or loss of
service.</p>
<p><b>Policies</b> are only intended for use with applications that have
  specific 'real-time' network policy
requirements, such as interactive voice and/or video services. </p>
<p>The network policy attributes advertised are:</p>
<p>1. Layer 2 VLAN ID (IEEE 802.1Q-2003)</p>
<p>2. Layer 2 priority value (IEEE 802.1D-2004)</p>
<p>3. Layer 3 Diffserv code point (DSCP) value (IETF RFC 2474)</p>
<p>This network policy is potentially advertised and associated with multiple sets of application types
supported on a given port. The application types specifically addressed are:</p>
<p>1. Voice</p>
<p>2. Guest Voice</p>
<p>3. Softphone Voice</p>
<p>4. Video Conferencing</p>
<p>5. Streaming Video</p>
<p>6. Control / Signalling (conditionally support a separate network
policy for the media types above)</p>
<p>A large network may support multiple VoIP policies across the entire organization, and different
policies per application type. LLDP-MED allows multiple policies to be advertised per port, each
corresponding to a different application type. Different ports on the same Network Connectivity
Device may advertise different sets of policies, based on the authenticated user identity or port
configuration.</p>
<p>It should be noted that LLDP-MED is not intended to run on links other than between Network
Connectivity Devices and Endpoints, and therefore does not need to advertise the multitude of
network policies that frequently run on an aggregated link interior to
the LAN.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Delete</dt>

<dd>
<p>Check to delete the policy. It will be deleted during the next save.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Policy ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>ID for the policy. This is auto generated and shall be used when
selecting the policies that shall be mapped to the specific ports.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Application Type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Intended use of the application types:</p>

<p>1. <b>Voice</b> - for use by dedicated IP Telephony handsets and other
similar appliances supporting interactive voice services. These devices are typically deployed on a separate VLAN for ease
of deployment and enhanced security by isolation from data
applications.</p>

<p>2. <b>Voice Signalling</b> (conditional) - for use in network topologies that require a
different policy for the voice signalling than for the voice media. This application type should not be advertised if
all the same network policies apply as those advertised in the <b>Voice</b>
application policy.</p>

<p>3. <b>Guest Voice</b> - support a separate 'limited feature-set' voice service for guest users and
visitors with their own IP Telephony handsets and other similar appliances supporting
interactive voice services.</p>

<p>4. <b>Guest Voice Signalling</b> (conditional) - for use in network topologies that require a different
policy for the guest voice signalling than for the guest voice media. This application type
should not be advertised if all the same network policies apply as those advertised in the
<b>Guest Voice</b> application policy.</p>

<p>5. <b>Softphone Voice</b> - for use by softphone applications on typical data centric devices, such as
PCs or laptops. This class of endpoints frequently does not support multiple VLANs, if at all,
and are typically configured to use an 'untagged' VLAN or a single 'tagged' data specific
VLAN. When a network policy is defined for use with an 'untagged' VLAN (see Tagged flag below), then the L2 priority field is ignored and only the DSCP value has relevance.</p>

<p>6. <b>Video Conferencing</b> - for use by dedicated Video Conferencing equipment and other similar
appliances supporting real-time interactive video/audio services.</p>

<p>7. <b>Streaming</b> Video - for use by broadcast or multicast based video content distribution and other
similar applications supporting streaming video services that require specific network policy
treatment. Video applications relying on TCP with buffering would not be an intended use of
this application type.</p>

<p>8. <b>Video Signalling</b> (conditional) - for use in network topologies that require a separate policy for
the video signalling than for the video media. This application type should not be advertised if
all the same network policies apply as those advertised in the <b>Video
Conferencing</b> application policy.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Tag</dt>
<dd>
<p><b>Tag</b> indicating whether the specified application type is using a 'tagged'
or an 'untagged' VLAN.</p>
<p><b>Untagged</b> indicates that the device is using an untagged frame format and as such does not include
a tag header as defined by IEEE 802.1Q-2003. In this case, both the VLAN ID and the Layer 2
priority fields are ignored and only the DSCP value has relevance. </p>
<p><b>Tagged</b> indicates that the device is using the IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame format, and that both the
VLAN ID and the Layer 2 priority values are being used, as well as the DSCP value. The tagged
format includes an additional field, known as the tag header. The tagged frame format also includes
priority tagged frames as defined by IEEE 802.1Q-2003.</p>
</dd>

<dt>VLAN ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>VLAN identifier (VID) for the port as defined in IEEE 802.1Q-2003.</p>
</dd>

<dt>L2 Priority</dt>
<dd>
<p><b>L2 Priority</b> is the  Layer 2 priority to be used for the
specified application type. <b>L2 Priority</b> may specify one of eight priority levels (0 through 7), as defined by IEEE 802.1D-2004. A value of
0 represents use of the default priority as defined in IEEE
802.1D-2004.</p>
</dd>

<dt>DSCP</dt>
<dd>
<p><b>DSCP</b> value to be used to provide Diffserv node behaviour for the specified
application type as defined in IETF RFC 2474. <b>DSCP</b>  may contain one of 64 code point
values (0 through 63). A value of 0 represents use of the default DSCP value as defined in RFC
2475.</p>
