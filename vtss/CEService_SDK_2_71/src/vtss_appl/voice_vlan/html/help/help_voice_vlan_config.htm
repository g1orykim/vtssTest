<h1>Voice VLAN Configuration Help</h1>

<h2><a href="glossary.htm#voice_vlan" class="glossary">Voice VLAN</a> Configuration</h2>

<p>The Voice VLAN feature enables voice traffic forwarding on the Voice VLAN,
   then the switch can classify and schedule network traffic.
   It is recommended that there be two VLANs on a port - one for voice, one for data. 
   Before connecting the <a href="glossary.htm#ip" class="glossary">IP</a> device to
   the switch, the IP phone should configure the 
   voice <a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a> correctly.
   It should be configured through its own GUI.
</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the Voice VLAN mode operation.
 We must disable MSTP feature before we enable Voice VLAN.
 It can avoid the conflict of ingress filtering.
 Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable Voice VLAN mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable Voice VLAN mode operation.
 </dd>

 <dt>VLAN ID</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the Voice VLAN ID. It should be a unique VLAN ID in the system and cannot equal each port PVID.
 It is a conflict in configuration if the value equals management VID, MVR VID, PVID etc.
 The allowed range is <samp>1</samp> to <samp>4095</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Aging Time</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the Voice VLAN secure learning aging time. The allowed range is <samp>10</samp> to <samp>10000000</samp> seconds.
 It is used when security mode or auto detect mode is enabled. In other cases, it will be based on hardware aging time. The actual
 aging time will be situated between the [age_time; 2 * age_time] interval. 
 </dd>

 <dt class="hasClassVoiceVlan">Traffic Class</dt>
 <dd class="hasClassVoiceVlan">
 Indicates the Voice VLAN traffic class. All traffic on the Voice VLAN will apply this class.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the Voice VLAN port mode.
 Possible port modes are:
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disjoin from Voice VLAN.
 <br><samp>Auto</samp>: Enable auto detect mode. It detects whether there is VoIP phone attached to the specific port and configures the Voice VLAN members automatically.
 <br><samp>Forced</samp>: Force join to Voice VLAN.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port Security</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the Voice VLAN port security mode. When the function is enabled, all non-telephonic MAC addresses in the Voice VLAN will be blocked for 10 seconds. 
 Possible port modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable Voice VLAN security mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable Voice VLAN security mode operation.
 </dd>

 <dt class="hasLLDPVoiceVlan">Port Discovery Protocol</dt>
 <dd class="hasLLDPVoiceVlan">
 Indicates the Voice VLAN port discovery protocol. It will only work when auto detect mode is enabled.
 We should enable LLDP feature before configuring discovery protocol to "LLDP" or "Both".
 Changing the discovery protocol to "OUI" or "LLDP" will restart auto detect process.
 Possible discovery protocols are:
 <br><samp><a href="glossary.htm#oui" class="glossary">OUI</a></samp>: Detect telephony device by OUI address.
 <br><samp><a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a></samp>: Detect telephony device by LLDP.
 <br><samp>Both</samp>: Both OUI and LLDP.
