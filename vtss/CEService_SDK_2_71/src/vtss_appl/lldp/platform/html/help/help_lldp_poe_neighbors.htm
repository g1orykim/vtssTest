<h1>LLDP Power Over Ethernet Neighbor Help</h1>

<p>This page provides a status overview for all <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> <a href="glossary.htm#PoE" class="glossary">PoE</a> neighbors.
   The displayed table contains a row for each port on which an <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> <a href="glossary.htm#PoE" class="glossary">PoE</a> neighbor is detected. The columns hold the following information:
</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Local Port</dt>
 <dd>
   The port for this switch on which the <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frame was received.
 </dd>

 <dt>Power Type</dt>
 <dd>
     The <b>Power Type</b> represents whether the device is a Power Sourcing Entity (PSE) or Power Device (<a href="glossary.htm#PD" class="glossary">PD</a>).
     <p>If the <b>Power Type</b> is unknown it is represented as "Reserved".</p>
  </dd>


 <dt>Power Source</dt>
 <dd>
    <p>The <b>Power Source</b> represents the power source being utilized by a PSE or <a href="glossary.htm#PD" class="glossary">PD</a> device.</p> 
    <p>If the device is a PSE device it can either run on its Primary Power Source or its Backup Power Source. 
       If it is unknown whether the PSE device is using its Primary Power Source or its Backup Power Source 
       it is indicated as "Unknown"  </p> 
    <p>If the device is a <a href="glossary.htm#PD" class="glossary">PD</a> device it can either run on its local power supply or it can use the PSE as power source. It can also use both its local power supply and the PSE.</p>
    <p>If it is unknown what power supply the <a href="glossary.htm#PD"
 class="glossary">PD</a> device is using it is indicated as "Unknown"  </p> 
 </dd>

 <dt>Power Priority</dt>
 <dd>
<p> Power <b>Power Priority</b> represents the priority of the <a href="glossary.htm#PD" class="glossary">PD</a> device, or the power priority associated with the PSE type device's port that is sourcing the power. There are three levels of power priority. The three levels are: Critical, High and Low. </p>
<p>If the power priority is unknown it is indicated as "Unknown" </p>  
 </dd>

<dt>Maximum Power</dt>
 <dd>
 <p> The <b>Maximum Power</b> Value contains a numerical value that indicates the maximum power in watts required by a <a href="glossary.htm#PD" class="glossary">PD</a> device from a PSE device, or the minimum power a PSE device is capable of sourcing over a maximum length cable based on its current configuration.</p>
 <p> The maximum allowed value is 102.3 W. If the device indicates value higher than 102.3 W, it is represented as "reserved"</p>
