 <dd>
 Specify the TCP "Acknowledgment field significant" (ACK) value for this ACE.
 <br><samp>0</samp>: TCP frames where the ACK field is set must not be able to match this entry.
 <br><samp>1</samp>: TCP frames where the ACK field is set must be able to match this entry.
 <br><samp>Any</samp>: Any value is allowed ("don't-care").

 <dd>
 Specify the Ethernet type filter for this ACE.
 <br><samp>Any</samp>: No EtherType filter is specified (EtherType filter status is "don't-care").
 <br><samp>Specific</samp>: If you want to filter a specific EtherType filter with this ACE, you can enter a specific EtherType value. A field for entering a EtherType value appears.
 </dd>

 <dt>Ethernet Type Value</dt>
 <dd>
 When "Specific" is selected for the EtherType filter, you can enter a specific EtherType value. The allowed range is <samp>0x600</samp> to <samp>0xFFFF</samp> but excluding 0x800(IPv4), 0x806(ARP) and 0x86DD(IPv6). A frame that hits this ACE matches this EtherType value.
