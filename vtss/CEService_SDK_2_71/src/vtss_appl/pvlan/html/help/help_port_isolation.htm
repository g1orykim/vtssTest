<h1>Port Isolation Configuration Help</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This page is used for enabling or disabling port isolation on ports in a <a href="glossary.htm#private_vlan" class="glossary">Private VLAN</a>.</p>

<p>
A port member of a <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a> can be isolated to other isolated ports on the
same VLAN<span class="Standalone_only"> and Private VLAN</span>.
</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The port settings relate to the currently
selected stack unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">This feature works across the stack.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

 <dd>

 A check box is provided for each port of a private VLAN.
<br>When checked, port isolation is enabled on that port.
<br>When unchecked, port isolation is disabled on that port.
 <br>By default, port isolation is disabled on all ports.
