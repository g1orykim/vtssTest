<h1>MLD Snooping VLAN Configuration Help</h1>



<h2> Navigating the <a href="glossary.htm#mld" class="glossary">MLD</a> Snooping <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a> Table</h2>
<p>
  Each page shows up to 99 entries from the VLAN table, default being 20, selected through the
  "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries from
  the beginning of the VLAN Table. The first displayed will be the one with the lowest <a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a>
  found in the VLAN Table.<br/>
  The "VLAN" input fields allow the user to select the starting point in the VLAN Table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the next closest VLAN Table match.<br/>
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed entry
  as a basis for the next lookup. When the end is reached the text "No more entries" is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.

<h2>MLD Snooping VLAN Table Columns</h2>
<dl>

 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd>
 Check to delete the entry. The designated entry will be deleted during the next save.
 </dd>

 <dt>VLAN ID</dt>
 <dd>
 The VLAN ID of the entry.
 </dd>

 <dt>MLD Snooping Enabled</dt>
 <dd>
 Enable the per-VLAN MLD Snooping. Up to 32 VLANs can be selected for MLD Snooping.
 </dd>

 <dt><a href="glossary.htm#querier_election" class="glossary">Querier Election</a></dt>
 <dd>
 Enable to join MLD Querier election in the VLAN.  Disable to act as a MLD Non-Querier.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">Compatibility</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Compatibility is maintained by hosts and routers taking appropriate actions
 depending on the versions of MLD operating on hosts and routers within a network.<br/>
 The allowed selection is <samp>MLD-Auto</samp>, <samp>Forced MLDv1</samp>,
 <samp>Forced MLDv2</samp>, default compatibility value is MLD-Auto.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">PRI</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Priority of Interface.<br/>
 It indicates the MLD control frame priority level generated by the system.
 These values can be used to prioritize different classes of traffic.<br/>
 The allowed range is <samp>0</samp> (best effort) to <samp>7</samp> (highest), default interface priority value is 0.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">RV</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Robustness Variable.<br/>
 The Robustness Variable allows tuning for the expected packet loss on a link.<br/>
 The allowed range is <samp>1</samp> to <samp>255</samp>, default robustness variable value is 2.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">QI</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Query Interval.<br/>
 The Query Interval is the interval between General Queries sent by the Querier.<br/>

 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">QRI</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Query Response Interval.<br/>
 The Maximum Response Delay used to calculate the Maximum Response Code inserted into the periodic General Queries.<br/>
 The allowed range is <samp>0</samp> to <samp>31744</samp> in tenths of seconds, default query response interval is 100 in tenths of seconds (10 seconds).

 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Last Listener Query Interval.<br/>
 The Last Listener Query Interval is the Maximum Response Delay used
 to calculate the Maximum Response Code inserted into Multicast
 Address Specific Queries sent in response to Version 1 Multicast
 Listener Done messages.  It is also the Maximum Response Delay used
 to calculate the Maximum Response Code inserted into Multicast
 Address and Source Specific Query messages.<br/>
 The allowed range is <samp>0</samp> to <samp>31744</samp> in tenths of seconds, default last listener query interval is 10 in tenths of seconds (1 second).

<h2>Buttons</h2>

<p><input type="button" value="Refresh">: Refreshes the displayed table starting from the "VLAN" input fields.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" |<< ">: Updates the table starting from the first entry in the VLAN Table, i.e. the entry with the lowest VLAN ID.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" >> ">: Updates the table, starting with the entry after the last entry currently displayed.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Add New MLD VLAN ">: Click to add new MLD VLAN.  Specify the VID and configure the new entry. Click "Save".
