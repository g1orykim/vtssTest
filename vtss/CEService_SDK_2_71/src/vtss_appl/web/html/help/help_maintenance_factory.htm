<h1>Maintenance Help</h1>

<h2><a name="factory">Factory Defaults</a></h2>

<p>You can reset the configuration of the
<span class="SPOM_only">stack</span>
<span class="Standalone_only">switch</span>
on this page. Only the <a href="glossary.htm#ip" class="glossary">IP</a> configuration is retained.</p>

<p>The new configuration is available immediately, which means that no restart is necessary.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Yes ">: Click to reset the configuration to Factory Defaults.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" No ">: Click to return to the Port State page without resetting the configuration.</p>


<p> Note: Restoring factory default can also be performed by making a
physical loopback between port 1 and port 2 within the first minute from
switch reboot. In the first minute after boot, 'loopback' packets will
be transmitted at port 1. If a 'loopback' packet is received at port 2 the
switch will do a restore to default </p>.
