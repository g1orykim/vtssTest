<h1>Firmware Selection Help</h1>

<p>This page provides information about the active and alternate
(backup) firmware images in the device, and allows you to revert to
the alternate image.</p>

<p>
The web page displays two tables with information about the active and
alternate firmware images.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Note:
<ol>

<li>In case the active firmware image is the alternate image, only the
"Active Image" table is shown. In this case, the <samp>Activate
Alternate Image</samp> button is also disabled. </li>

<li>If the alternate image is active (due to a corruption of the
primary image or by manual intervention), uploading a new firmware
image to the device will automatically use the primary image slot and
activate this.</li>

<li>The firmware version and date information may be empty for older
firmware releases. This does not constitute an error. </li>

</ol>
