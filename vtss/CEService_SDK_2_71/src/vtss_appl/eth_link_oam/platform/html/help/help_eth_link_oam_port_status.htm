<h1>Link OAM Port Configuration Status Help</h1>

<p>This page provides Link OAM configuration operational status.</p>

<p>The displayed fields shows the active configuration status for the selected port.
</p>

<h2>Local and Peer</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 The Mode in which the Link OAM is operating, Active or Passive.
 </dd>

 <dt>Unidirectional Operation Support</dt>
 <dd>
    This feature is not available to be configured by the user. The status of this configuration is retrieved from the PHY. 
 </dd>

 <dt>Remote Loopback Support</dt>
 <dd>
     If status is enabled, DTE is capable of OAM remote loopback mode.
 </dd>

 <dt>Link Monitoring Support</dt>
 <dd>
     If status is enabled, DTE supports interpreting Link Events.
 </dd>

 <dt>MIB Retrieval Support</dt>
 <dd>
     If status ie enabled DTE supports sending Variable Response OAMPDUs.
 </dd>

 <dt>MTU Size</dt>
 <dd>
     It represents the largest OAMPDU, in octets, supported by the DTE. This value is compared to the remotes
     Maximum PDU Size and the smaller of the two is used.
 </dd>

 <dt>Multiplexer State</dt>
 <dd>
     When in forwarding state, the Device is forwarding non-OAMPDUs to the lower sublayer. Incase of discarding, the device discards all the 
     non-OAMPDU's. 
 </dd>

<dt>Parser State </dt>
<dd>
     When in forwarding state, Device is forwarding non-OAMPDUs to higher sublayer. When in loopback, Device is looping back non-OAMPDUs to the lower sublayer.
     When in discarding state, Device is discarding non-OAMPDUs.
</dd>

<dt>Organizational Unique Identification </dt>
<dd> 
    24-bit Organizationally Unique Identifier of the vendor. 
</dd>
<dt>PDU Revision </dt>
<dd>
     It indicates the current revision of the Information TLV. The value of this field shall start at zero and be incremented each time something in the Information TLV
     changes. Upon reception of an Information TLV from a peer, an OAM client may use this field to decide if it needs to be processed (an Information TLV that is identical to the previous Information
     TLV doesn't need to be parsed as nothing in it has changed).
</dd>
<dt>PDU Permission</dt>
<dd>
    This field is available only for the Local DTE. It displays the current permission rules set for the local DTE. Possible values are 
    "Link fault","Receive only", "Information exchange only","ANY".  
</dd>
<dt>Discovery State </dt>
<dd>Displays the current state of the discovery process. Possible states are Fault state, Active state, Passive state,
    SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_STATE, SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK_STATE, SEND_ANY_STATE. </dd>
</dl>

<p><i>The port select box determines which port is affected by clicking the buttons.</i></p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Refresh " disabled >: Click to refresh the page immediately.</p>
<p>Auto-refresh<input type="checkbox" disabled>: Check this box to enable an automatic refresh. Automatic refresh occurs every <span class="refreshInterval">?</span> seconds.</p>
