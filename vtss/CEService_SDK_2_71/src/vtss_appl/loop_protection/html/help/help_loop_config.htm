<p>This page allows the user to inspect the current Loop Protection
configurations, and possibly change them as well.</p>

<fieldset>
<legend>General Settings</legend>

<dl>
 <dt>Enable Loop Protection</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls whether loop protections is enabled (as a whole).
 </dd>

 <dt>Transmission Time</dt>
 <dd>
   The interval between each loop protection PDU sent on each port.
   valid values are 1 to 10 seconds.
 </dd>

 <dt>Shutdown Time</dt>
 <dd>
   The period (in seconds) for which a port will be kept disabled in
   the event of a loop is detected (and the port action 
   shuts down the port). Valid values are 0 to 604800 seconds
   (7 days). A value of zero will keep a port disabled (until next
   device restart).

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   The switch port number of the port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Enable</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls whether loop protection is enabled on this switch port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Action</dt>
 <dd>
   Configures the action performed when a loop is detected on a port.
   Valid values are <samp>Shutdown Port</samp>, <samp>Shutdown Port and
   Log</samp> or <samp>Log Only</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Tx Mode</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls whether the port is actively generating loop protection
   PDU's, or whether it is just passively looking for looped PDU's.
