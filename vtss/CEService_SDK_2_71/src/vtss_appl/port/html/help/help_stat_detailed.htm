<h1>Detailed Port Statistics Help</h1>

<p>This page provides detailed traffic statistics for a specific switch port. 
Use the port select box to select which switch port details to display.</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The selected port belongs to the currently selected stack
unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<p>The displayed counters are the totals for receive and transmit, the size counters for receive and transmit, and the error counters for receive and transmit.</p>

<h2>Receive Total and Transmit Total</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>Rx and Tx Packets</dt>
 <dd>
 The number of received and transmitted (good and bad) packets.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Octets</dt>
 <dd>
The number of received and transmitted (good and bad) bytes. Includes FCS, but excludes framing bits.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Unicast</dt>
 <dd>
The number of received and transmitted (good and bad) unicast packets.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Multicast</dt>
 <dd>
The number of received and transmitted (good and bad) multicast packets.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Broadcast</dt>
 <dd>
The number of received and transmitted (good and bad) broadcast packets.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx and Tx Pause</dt>
 <dd>
A count of the MAC Control frames received or transmitted on this port that have an opcode indicating a PAUSE operation.
 </dd>

</dl>

<h2>Receive and Transmit Size Counters</h2>

The number of received and transmitted (good and bad) packets split
into categories based on their respective frame sizes.

<div class="has_qos">
<h2>Receive and Transmit Queue Counters</h2>

The number of received and transmitted packets per input and output queue.
</div>

<h2>Receive Error Counters</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>Rx Drops</dt>
 <dd>The number of frames dropped due to lack of receive buffers or egress congestion.</dd>

 <dt>Rx CRC/Alignment</dt>
 <dd>The number of frames received with CRC or alignment errors.</dd>

 <dt>Rx Undersize</dt>
 <dd>The number of short<small><sup>&nbsp;1</sup></small> frames received with valid CRC.</dd>

 <dt>Rx Oversize</dt>
 <dd>The number of long<small><sup>&nbsp;2</sup></small> frames received with valid CRC.</dd>

 <dt>Rx Fragments</dt>
 <dd>The number of short<small><sup>&nbsp;1</sup></small> frames received with invalid CRC.</dd>
 <dt>Rx Jabber</dt>
 <dd>The number of long<small><sup>&nbsp;2</sup></small> frames received with invalid CRC.</dd>

 <dt>Rx Filtered</dt>
 <dd>The number of received frames filtered by the forwarding process.</dd>

</dl>
<p><small><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></small>Short frames are frames that are smaller than 64 bytes.</p>
<p><small><sup>2&nbsp;</sup></small>Long frames are frames that are longer than the configured maximum frame length for this port.</p>

<h2>Transmit Error Counters</h2>

<dl>

 <dt>Tx Drops</dt>
 <dd>
The number of frames dropped due to output buffer congestion.
 </dd>

 <dt>Tx Late/Exc. Coll.</dt>
 <dd>
 The number of frames dropped due to excessive or late collisions.
 </dd>

</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><i>The port select box determines which port is affected by clicking the buttons.</i></p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Refresh ">: Click to refresh the page immediately.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Clear ">: Clears the counters for the selected port.</p>
<p>Auto-refresh<input type="checkbox">: Check this box to refresh the page automatically. Automatic refresh occurs every <span class="refreshInterval">?</span> seconds.</p>
