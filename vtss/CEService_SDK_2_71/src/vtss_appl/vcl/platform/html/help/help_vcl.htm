<h1>VCL MAC-Based VLAN Configuration Help</h1>

<p>
  The MAC-based VLAN entries can be configured here. This page allows for adding and deleting MAC-based VLAN
  entries and assigning the entries to different ports. This page shows only static entries.
</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd >
  To delete a MAC-based VLAN entry, check this box and press save. The entry will be deleted <span class="SPOM_only">on
  the selected switch </span> in the stack.
 </dd>

 <dt>MAC Address</dt>
 <dd>
  Indicates the MAC address.
 </dd>

 <dt>VLAN ID</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the VLAN ID.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port Members</dt>
 <dd>
  A row of check boxes for each port is displayed for each MAC-based VLAN entry. To include a port in
  a MAC-based VLAN, check the box. To remove or exclude the port from the MAC-based VLAN, make sure the 
  box is unchecked. By default, no ports are members, and all boxes are unchecked.
 </dd>

 <dt>Adding a New MAC-based VLAN</dt>
 <dd>
   Click <input type="button" value=" Add New Entry "> to add a new MAC-based VLAN entry. An empty row 
   is added to the table, and the MAC-based VLAN entry can be configured as needed. Any unicast MAC address 
   can be configured for the MAC-based VLAN entry. No broadcast or multicast MAC addresses are allowed.
   Legal values for a VLAN ID are <samp>1</samp> through <samp>4095</samp>.<br/><br/>
   The MAC-based VLAN entry is enabled <span class="SPOM_only">on the selected stack switch unit</span> 
   when you click on "Save".
   A MAC-based VLAN without any port members <span class="SPOM_only">on any stack unit </span>will be 
   deleted when you click "Save".<br/><br/> The <input type="button" value=" Delete "> button can be 
   used to undo the addition of new MAC-based VLANs.
   The maximum possible MAC-based VLAN entries are limited to 256.
 </dd>
