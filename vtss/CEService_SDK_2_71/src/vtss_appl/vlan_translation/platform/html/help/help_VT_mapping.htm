<h1>VLAN Translation Table Help</h1>

<p>This page allows you to map VLAN ID to other VLAN ID for a particular Group ID Globally.</p>

<p>The displayed settings are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd>To delete a VLAN Translation Group database entry, check this box. The entry will be deleted on the switch during the next Save</dd>
 <dt >Group ID</dt>
 <dd>A valid Group ID is an integer value from 1 to <script type="text/javascript"> document.write(configNormalPortMax); </script>.
    A set of VLAN Translations are mapped to a group Id. This way a port is mapped to
    a list of VLAN Translations easily by mapping it to a group. Number of groups in a 
    switch is equal to the number of ports present in this switch. A port can be mapped 
    to any of the groups. Multiple ports can also be mapped to a group with same group Id.<br />
    <b>Note:</b>
	By default,
	each port is mapped to a group with a group Id equal to the port number. For
	example, port 1 is mapped to the group with ID=1.
    
  </dd>
 <dt><a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a></dt>
 <dd>Indicates the ID to which Group ID will be mapped. A valid VLAN ID ranges from 1-4095.</dd>
<dt>Translated to VLAN ID</dt>
<dd>
Indicates the VID to which VLAN ID of ingress frames will be changed, if VID in incoming
frames if same as configured in VLAN ID field preceded by this field on member ports of a
particular group to which this entry belongs.
 </dd>
 <dt>Adding a New VLAN Translation entry</dt>
 <dd>
   Click <input type="button" value=" Add New Entry "> to add a new entry in VLAN Translation table. An empty row is added
   to the table, the Group ID, VLAN ID and  Translated to VID fields can be configured as needed. Legal values for a VLAN ID are
   <samp>1</samp> through <samp>4095</samp>.<br/><br/>
   The <input type="button" value=" Delete "> button can be used to undo the addition of new entry.
