  Uncheck "Force Cool Restart" if you want to perform a warm restart of the 
  <span class="SPOM_only">stack</span>
  <span class="Standalone_only">switch</span>

  Check "Force Cool Restart" if you want to simulate a power-on (cold restart) of the
  <span class="SPOM_only">stack</span>
  <span class="Standalone_only">switch</span>
  after the software upload.
  <br>
  <i><b>Warning</b>: Forcing a cool restart will affect the traffic going through the
