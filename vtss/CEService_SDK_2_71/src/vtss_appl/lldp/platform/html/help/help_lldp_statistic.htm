<h1>LLDP Statistics Help</h1>


<p>This page provides an overview of all <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> traffic.
  </p><br/>
  Two types of counters are shown. <b>Global counters</b> are counters that refer to the whole
<span class="SPOM_only">stack,</span>
<span class="Standalone_only">switch,</span>
  while <b>local counters</b> refer to per port counters for the currently selected switch.

<br/>
<h2>Global Counters</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Neighbor entries were last changed </dt>
 <dd>
   Shows the time when the last entry was last deleted or added. It also shows the time elapsed since the last change was detected.
 </dd>
 <dt>Total Neighbors Entries Added</dt>
 <dd>
   Shows the number of new entries added since switch reboot.
 </dd>
 <dt>Total Neighbors Entries Deleted</dt>
 <dd>
   Shows the number of new entries deleted since switch reboot.
 </dd>
 <dt>Total Neighbors Entries Dropped</dt>
 <dd>
   Shows the number of <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frames dropped due to the entry table being full.
 </dd>
 <dt>Total Neighbors Entries Aged Out</dt>
 <dd>
   Shows the number of entries deleted due to Time-To-Live expiring.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Local Counters</h2>
   The displayed table contains a row for each port. The columns hold the following information:
<dl>
 <dt>Local Port</dt>
 <dd>
    The port on which <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frames are received or transmitted.
 </dd>

 <dt>Tx Frames</dt>
 <dd>
    The number of <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frames transmitted on the port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx Frames</dt>
 <dd>
    The number of <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frames received on the port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Rx Errors</dt>
 <dd>
   The number of received <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frames containing some kind of error. 
 </dd>

 <dt>Frames Discarded</dt>
 <dd>
   If a <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frame is received on a port, and the switch's internal table has run full, the <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frame is counted and discarded.
   This situation is known as "Too Many Neighbors" in the <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> standard.
   <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frames require a new entry in the table when the Chassis ID or Remote Port ID is not already contained within the table.
   Entries are removed from the table when a given port's link is down, an <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> shutdown frame is received, or when the entry ages out.
 </dd>

 <dt>TLVs Discarded</dt>
 <dd>
    Each <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frame can contain multiple pieces of information, known as TLVs (TLV is short for "Type Length Value"). If a TLV is malformed, it is counted and discarded.
  </dd>

 <dt>TLVs Unrecognized</dt>
 <dd>
    The number of well-formed TLVs, but with an unknown type value.
 </dd>

 <dt>Org. Discarded</dt>
 <dd>
    If <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frame is received with an organizationally TLV, but the TLV is not supported the TLV is discarded and counted.
 </dd>

 <dt>Age-Outs</dt>
 <dd>
    Each <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frame contains information about how long time the <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> information is valid (age-out time). If no new <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> frame is received within the age out time, the <a href="glossary.htm#lldp" class="glossary">LLDP</a> information is removed, and the <b>Age-Out</b> counter is incremented. 
 </dd>
