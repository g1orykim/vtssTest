    <a href="glossary.htm#ace" class="glossary">ACE</a> is an acronym for <u>A</u>ccess <u>C</u>ontrol <u>E</u>ntry.
  It describes access permission associated with a particular ACE ID.
  <p>There are three ACE frame types (<a href="glossary.htm#ethernet_type" class="glossary">Ethernet Type</a>, <a href="glossary.htm#arp" class="glossary">ARP</a>, and IPv4) 
  and two ACE actions (permit and deny). The ACE also contains many 
  detailed, different parameter options that are available for individual 
  application.</p>
  </dd>

  <dd>
    <a href="glossary.htm#acl" class="glossary">ACL</a> is an acronym for <u>A</u>ccess <u>C</u>ontrol <u>L</u>ist.
  It is the list table of <a href="glossary.htm#ace" class="glossary">ACE</a>s, containing access control entries that
  specify individual users or groups permitted or denied to specific
  traffic objects, such as a process or a program.
  <p>Each accessible traffic object contains an identifier to its ACL.
  The privileges determine whether there are specific traffic object access rights.</p>
  <p>ACL implementations can be quite complex, for example, when the ACEs are
  prioritized for the various situation. In networking, the ACL refers
  to a list of service ports or network services that are available on
  a host or server, each with a list of hosts or servers permitted or
  denied to use the service. ACL can generally be configured to control
  inbound traffic, and in this context, they
  are similar to firewalls.</p>
  <p>There are 3 web-pages associated with the manual ACL configuration:</p>

  <br><samp>ACL|Access Control List</samp>:
  The web page shows the ACEs in a prioritized way, highest (top) to lowest (bottom).  Default the table is empty.  
  An ingress frame will only get a hit on one ACE even though there are more matching ACEs.  
  The first matching ACE will take action (permit/deny) on that frame and a counter associated with that ACE is incremented.
  An ACE can be associated with a Policy, 1 ingress port, or any ingress port (the whole switch).  
  If an ACE Policy is created then that Policy can be associated with a group of ports under the "Ports" web-page.
  There are number of parameters that can be configured with an ACE.  Read the Web page help text to get further information for each of them.
  The maximum number of ACEs is 64.

  <br><samp>ACL|Ports</samp>:
  The ACL Ports configuration is used to assign a Policy ID to an ingress port.  This is useful to group ports to obey the same traffic rules.  
  Traffic Policy is created under the "Access Control List" - page.
  You can you also set up specific traffic properties (Action / Rate Limiter / Port copy, etc) for each ingress port.  
  They will though only apply if the frame gets past the ACE matching without getting matched.  
  In that case a counter associated with that port is incremented.   See the Web page help text for each specific port property.

  <br><samp>ACL|Rate Limiters</samp>:
  Under this page you can configure the rate limiters.  There can be 15 different rate limiters, each ranging from 1-1024K packets per seconds.  
  Under "Ports" and "Access Control List" web-pages you can assign a Rate Limiter ID to the ACE(s) or ingress port(s).

    <a href="glossary.htm#dhcp" class="glossary">DHCP</a> is an acronym for <u>D</u>ynamic <u>H</u>ost <u>C</u>onfiguration <u>P</u>rotocol.
  It is a protocol used for assigning dynamic <a href="glossary.htm#ip" class="glossary">IP</a> addresses to devices on a network. 
  <p>DHCP used by networked computers (clients) to obtain IP addresses 
  and other parameters such as the default gateway, subnet mask, and IP 
  addresses of <a href="glossary.htm#dns" class="glossary">DNS</a> servers from a DHCP server.</p>
  <p>The DHCP server ensures that all IP addresses are unique, for example, no 
  IP address is assigned to a second client while the first client's 
  assignment is valid (its lease has not expired). Therefore, IP address pool 
  management is done by the server and not by a human network administrator.</p>
  <p>Dynamic addressing simplifies network administration because the 
  software keeps track of IP addresses rather than requiring an administrator 
  to manage the task. This means that a new computer can be added to a 
  network without the hassle of manually assigning it a unique IP address.</p>

  <dd>
  <a href="glossary.htm#dhcp_relay" class="glossary">DHCP Relay</a> is used to
  forward and to transfer DHCP messages between the clients and the server when
  they are not on the same subnet domain.
  <p>The DHCP option 82 enables a DHCP relay agent to insert specific information
  into a DHCP request packets when forwarding client DHCP packets to a DHCP server
  and remove the specific information from a DHCP reply packets when forwarding
  server DHCP packets to a DHCP client. The DHCP server can use this information to
  implement IP address or other assignment policies. Specifically the option works
  by setting two sub-options: Circuit ID (option 1) and Remote ID (option2). The
  Circuit ID sub-option is supposed to include information specific to which circuit
  the request came in on. The Remote ID sub-option was designed to carry information
  relating to the remote host end of the circuit.</p>
  <p>The definition of Circuit ID in the switch is 4 bytes in length and the format
  is "vlan_id" "module_id" "port_no". The parameter of "vlan_id" is the first two
  bytes represent the VLAN ID. The parameter of "module_id" is the third byte for the
  module ID (in standalone switch it always equal 0, in stackable switch it means
  switch ID). The parameter of "port_no" is the fourth byte and it means the port number.
 <br>The Remote ID is 6 bytes in length, and the value is equal the DHCP relay agents MAC address.</p>

  <p>HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what 
  actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various

  <p>IP is a "best effort" system, which means that no packet of

  <p>The current version of the Internet protocol is IPv4, which has 
  32-bits Internet Protocol addresses allowing for in excess of four 
  billion unique addresses. This number is reduced drastically by the 
  practice of webmasters taking addresses in large blocks, the bulk of 
  which remain unused. There is a rather substantial movement to adopt 
  a new version of the Internet Protocol, IPv6, which would have 128-bits 
  Internet Protocol addresses. This number can be represented roughly by 
  a three with thirty-nine zeroes after it. However, IPv4 is still the

    <a href="glossary.htm#tcp" class="glossary">TCP</a> is an acronym for <u>T</u>ransmission <u>C</u>ontrol <u>P</u>rotocol.
  It is a communications protocol that uses the Internet Protocol (<a href="glossary.htm#ip" class="glossary">IP</a>) 
  to exchange the messages between computers.
  <p>The TCP protocol guarantees reliable and in-order delivery of data 
  from sender to receiver and distinguishes data for multiple connections 
  by concurrent applications (for example, Web server and e-mail server) running 
  on the same host.</p>
  <p>The applications on networked hosts can use TCP to create connections 
  to one another. It is known as a connection-oriented protocol, which 
  means that a connection is established and maintained until such time 
  as the message or messages to be exchanged by the application programs 
  at each end have been exchanged. TCP is responsible for ensuring that 
  a message is divided into the packets that IP manages and for reassembling 
  the packets back into the complete message at the other end.</p>
  <p>Common network applications that use TCP include the World Wide Web (WWW), 
  e-mail, and File Transfer Protocol (<a href="glossary.htm#ftp" class="glossary">FTP</a>).</p>

  <p>TELNET enables the client to control the server and communicate with other 
  servers on the network. To start a Telnet session, the client user must 
  log in to a server by entering a valid username and password. Then, the

  It is a communications protocol that uses the Internet Protocol (<a href="glossary.htm#ip" class="glossary">IP</a>) 
  to exchange the messages between computers. 
  <p>UDP is an alternative to the Transmission Control Protocol (<a href="glossary.htm#tcp" class="glossary">TCP</a>) 
  that uses the Internet Protocol (IP). Unlike TCP, UDP does not provide 
  the service of dividing a message into packet datagrams, and UDP doesn't 
  provide reassembling and sequencing of the packets. This means that the 
  application program that uses UDP must be able to make sure that the 
  entire message has arrived and is in the right order. Network applications 
  that want to save processing time because they have very small data 
  units to exchange may prefer UDP to TCP.</p> 
  <p>UDP provides two services not provided by the IP layer. It provides 
  port numbers to help distinguish different user requests and, optionally, 
  a checksum capability to verify that the data arrived intact.</p>
  <p>Common network applications that use UDP include the 
  Domain Name System (<a href="glossary.htm#dns" class="glossary">DNS</a>), streaming media applications such as IPTV,
