<h1>STP Bridge Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows you to configure STP system settings. The settings
are used by all STP Bridge instances in the Switch
<span class="SPOM_only"> Stack</span>.</p>

<fieldset>
 <legend>Basic Settings</legend>

<dl>
 <dt>Protocol Version</dt> 
 <dd>
   The 
   <a href="glossary.htm#mstp" class="glossary">MSTP</a> /
   <a href="glossary.htm#rstp" class="glossary">RSTP</a> /
   <a href="glossary.htm#stp" class="glossary">STP</a> protocol
   version setting. Valid values
   are <samp>STP</samp>, <samp>RSTP</samp> and <samp>MSTP</samp>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Bridge Priority</dt> 
 <dd>
   Controls the bridge priority. Lower numeric values have better
   priority. The bridge priority plus the MSTI instance number,
   concatenated with the 6-byte MAC address of the switch forms
   a <em>Bridge Identifier</em>.
   <br>For <samp>MSTP</samp> operation, this is the priority of the
   CIST. Otherwise, this is the priority of the STP/RSTP bridge.
 </dd>

 <dt>Forward Delay</dt>
 <dd>
    The delay used by STP Bridges to transit Root and Designated
    Ports to Forwarding (used in STP compatible mode). Valid values are in the range 4 to 30 seconds.
 </dd>

 <dt>Max Age</dt>
 <dd>
   The maximum age of the information transmitted by the Bridge when
   it is the Root Bridge. Valid values are in the range 6 to 40 seconds, 
   <em>and</em> MaxAge must be <= (FwdDelay-1)*2.
 </dd>

 <dt>Maximum Hop Count</dt>
 <dd>
   This defines the initial value of remaining Hops for MSTI
   information generated at the boundary of an MSTI region. It defines
   how many bridges a root bridge can distribute its BPDU
   information to. 
   Valid values are in the range 6 to 40 hops.
 </dd>

 <dt>Transmit Hold Count</dt>
 <dd>
   The number of BPDU's a bridge port can send per second. When
   exceeded, transmission of the next BPDU will be delayed. Valid
   values are in the range 1 to 10 BPDU's per second.
 </dd>

</dl>

<dl>

 <dt>Edge Port BPDU Filtering</dt>
 <dd>
   Control whether a port <em>explicitly</em> configured
   as <samp>Edge</samp> will transmit and receive BPDUs.
 </dd>

 <dt>Edge Port BPDU Guard</dt>
 <dd>
   Control whether a port <em>explicitly</em> configured
   as <samp>Edge</samp> will disable itself upon reception of a BPDU.
   The port will enter the <em>error-disabled</em> state, and will be
   removed from the active topology.
 </dd>

 <dt><a name="recovery">Port Error Recovery</a></dt>
 <dd>
   Control whether a port in the <em>error-disabled</em> state
   automatically will be enabled after a certain time. If recovery is
   not enabled, ports have to be disabled and re-enabled for normal
   STP operation. The condition is also cleared by a system reboot.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port Error Recovery Timeout</dt>
 <dd>
   The time to pass before a port in the
   <em>error-disabled</em> state can be enabled. Valid values are
   between 30 and 86400 seconds (24 hours).
 </dd>
