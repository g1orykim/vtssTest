<h1>CPU Load Help</h1>

<p>This page displays the CPU load, using an SVG graph.</p>

<p>The load is measured as averaged over the last 100ms, 1sec and 10
seconds intervals. The last 120 samples are graphed, and the last
numbers are displayed as text as well.</p>

<p>In order to display the SVG graph, your browser must support the
SVG format. Consult the <a target="_blank"
href="http://wiki.svg.org/index.php/Viewer_Implementations">SVG Wiki</a> for
more information on browser support. Specifically, at the time of
writing, Microsoft Internet Explorer will need to have a plugin
installed to support SVG.</p>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p>Auto-refresh<input type="checkbox">: Check this box to refresh the page automatically. Automatic refresh occurs every <span class="refreshInterval">?</span> seconds.</p>
