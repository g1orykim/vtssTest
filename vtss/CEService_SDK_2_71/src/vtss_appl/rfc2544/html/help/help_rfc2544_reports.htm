<h1>RFC2544 Report Overview Help</h1>

<p>
  This page provides an overview of the currently stored reports along with options for deleting, downloading, and viewing them. Also initiation of execution of a profile is also handled through this page.<br/>
  If no reports are currently stored, the table contains one line stating &quot;&lt;No test reports&gt;&quot;.
  Otherwise there is a table row for each test report, each containing these elements:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Action</dt>
  <dd>
    If a test is currently being executed, a <input type="button" value=" Stop ">-button is shown.
    Clicking the Stop-button will cause a request to be sent to gracefully cancel the execution.
    During this cancellation, the button will be disabled. At most one test can execute at a time.<br/>
    Once execution of a test is complete, successfully or not, the resulting report is persisted to non-volatile memory.
    Up to <span class="report_cnt">?</span> reports can be persisted. New reports will replace the oldest.<br/>
    Only reports stored in non-volatile memory can be erased. This is done with the <input type="button" value=" Delete ">-button.
  </dd>

  <dt>Save</dt>
  <dd>
    Test reports can be downloaded and stored on the local computer with the use of the <input type="button" value=" Save ">-button.
    The suggested file name will be the report name concatenated with &quot;.txt&quot;.
  </dd>

  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd>
    A unique name identifying the report. Click the name to view the report.
  </dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    The description assigned to the report as entered on the test execution page, invoked with the <input type="button" value=" Start New Test ">-button.
  </dd>

  <dt>Created</dt>
  <dd>
    The date and time at which execution started.
  </dd>

  <dt>Status</dt>
  <dd>
    The current status of executing a test:
    <ul>
      <li><samp>Inactive</samp>: Test just initiated, but not started. This is a transitional state that is unlikely to be noticed.</li>
      <li><samp>Executing</samp>: Test is currently executing. At most one test can execute at a time.</li>
      <li><samp>Cancelling</samp>: Test has just been stopped by the user. This is a transitional state that is unlikely to be noticed.</li>
      <li><samp>Cancelled</samp>: Test was stopped by the user and report is stored in non-volatile memory.</li>
      <li><samp>Passed</samp>: Test passed successfully and reports is stored in non-volatile memory.</li>
      <li><samp>Failed</samp>: Test failed execution and report is stored in non-volatile memory. Details as to why the test failed are embedded in the report.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><input type="button" value=" Start New Test ">: Initiate execution of a profile. This button is grayed out if a test is already in progress.</p>
<p>Auto-refresh<input type="checkbox">: Check this box to refresh the page automatically. Automatic refresh occurs every <span class="refreshInterval">?</span> seconds.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Refresh ">: Click to refresh the page immediately.</p>
